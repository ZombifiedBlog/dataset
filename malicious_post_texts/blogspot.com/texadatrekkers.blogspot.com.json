I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.

Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 12nEVuGNtRFMVjeVmLtD4nt2sHX68S47yH   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Why couldn't I get any alerts?\" \r<br/>To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis, \r<br/>which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.\r<br/> <br/>I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/>Still puzzled how much damage could that cause?

(&gt;_&lt;)\r<br/> <br/>The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.\r<br/>I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.\r<br/>I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.\r<br/>My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.\r<br/> <br/>So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...\r<br/> <br/>While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.\r<br/>You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.\r<br/>I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.\r<br/> <br/>If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.\r<br/>It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.\r<br/>I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.\r<br/> <br/>Let's resolve it like this:\r<br/>All you need is $1750 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.\r<br/>Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.\r<br/> <br/>That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.\r<br/>If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1P8zGx51BpyxEy5jBgr5ugoPXbSgyd7fpw\r<br/> <br/>You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).\r<br/> <br/>Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately. \r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them.
