All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\nHello there!\r<br/> <br/>Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.\r<br/>Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.\r<br/>Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.\r<br/> <br/>Below, is the sequence of past events: \r<br/>In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).\r<br/>Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (<a href=\"mailto:terrybd.mrincn@blogger.com\">terrybd.mrincn@blogger.com</a>).\r<br/> <br/>A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.\r<br/>Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).\r<br/>All smart things are quite straightforward.\r<br/> <br/>The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.\r<br/>I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.\r<br/>I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.\r<br/>My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.\r<br/> <br/>So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...\r<br/> <br/>While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.\r<br/>You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.\r<br/>I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.\r<br/> <br/>If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.\r<br/>It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.\r<br/>I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.\r<br/> <br/>Let's resolve it like this:\r<br/>All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.\r<br/>Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.\r<br/> <br/>That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.\r<br/>If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1P9V9BQ83wdEXGm3KmGxXMAdCVeXSd5W3Z\r<br/> <br/>You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).\r<br/> <br/>Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately. \r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hello there!Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.Below, is the sequence of past events:In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (terrybd.mrincn@blogger.com).A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).All smart things are quite straightforward.The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1P9V9BQ83wdEXGm3KmGxXMAdCVeXSd5W3ZYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<div class=\"WordSection1\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hi there!   I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!   I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!",

(^_^)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1650 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1B4h63LjY8ZZBLuk1r5s6HkeVRV5W6uRE2You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours.

It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated.

It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 15DMMwLTqV4RmYpJZDoNUZvzNikX1m6j4RThe fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.Obviously do not try to ask for help from the law enforcement unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.Take care and have a good day.",

With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1490 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1Q7oKyU8HWEZk2RhP9AapqdnuCy9p3TUAqAfter receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\nHello!\r<br/> <br/>I have very bad news for you.\r<br/>12/03/2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account <a href=\"mailto:terrybd.mrincn@blogger.com\">terrybd.mrincn@blogger.com</a> <br/> <br/>So, you can change the password, yes... But my malware intercepts it every time.\r<br/> <br/>How I made it:\r<br/>In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.\r<br/>I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.\r<br/>When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.\r<br/> <br/>After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).\r<br/> <br/>A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.\r<br/>But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!\r<br/>I'm talk you about sites for adults.\r<br/> <br/>I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!\r<br/> <br/>And I got an idea....\r<br/>I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).\r<br/>After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.\r<br/>Turned out amazing!
