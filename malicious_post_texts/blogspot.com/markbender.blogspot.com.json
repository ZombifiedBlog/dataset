I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 18JafCUSR3JWJuxbSH9Wp4AUizzTwkZz9D   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

You have my honest word, that all the harmful software will also be deactivated and deleted from all your devices currently in use. <br/>  Worry not, I keep my promises.<br/>  That is truly a win-win solution that comes at a relatively reduced cost, mostly knowing how much effort I spent on monitoring your profile and traffic for a considerably long time.<br/>  In event that you have no idea about means of buying and transferring bitcoins – don't hesitate to use any search engine for your assistance (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.).<br/> <br/>  My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 19yaJM8qhsyXnwoQP7zQbMkqJStoMYxPmE<br/> <br/>  I have allocated 48 hours for you to do that, and the timer started right after you opened this very email (2 days to be exact).<br/> <br/>  Don't even think of doing anything of the following:<br/>  *Abstain from attempting to reply me (this email was created by me inside your inbox page and the return address was generated accordingly).<br/>  *Abstain from attempting to get in touch with police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing this to you friends. <br/>   Once I discover this (apparently, that is absolutely easy for me, taking in consideration that I have complete control over all systems you use) - your kinky video will straight away be made public. <br/>  *Don't even think of attempting to find me – that is completely useless. Don't forget that all cryptocurrency transactions remain completely anonymous.<br/>  *Don't attempt reinstalling the OS on all your devices or getting rid of them.

You have my honest word, that all the harmful software will also be deactivated and deleted from all your devices currently in use.Worry not, I keep my promises.That is truly a win-win solution that comes at a relatively reduced cost, mostly knowing how much effort I spent on monitoring your profile and traffic for a considerably long time.In event that you have no idea about means of buying and transferring bitcoins – don't hesitate to use any search engine for your assistance (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.).My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 19yaJM8qhsyXnwoQP7zQbMkqJStoMYxPmEI have allocated 48 hours for you to do that, and the timer started right after you opened this very email (2 days to be exact).Don't even think of doing anything of the following:*Abstain from attempting to reply me (this email was created by me inside your inbox page and the return address was generated accordingly).*Abstain from attempting to get in touch with police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing this to you friends.Once I discover this (apparently, that is absolutely easy for me, taking in consideration that I have complete control over all systems you use) - your kinky video will straight away be made public.*Don't even think of attempting to find me – that is completely useless. Don't forget that all cryptocurrency transactions remain completely anonymous.*Don't attempt reinstalling the OS on all your devices or getting rid of them. That won't lead you to success either, because I have already saved all videos at my remote servers as a backup.Things you should not be concerned about:*That your funds transfer won't reach my wallet.- Worry not, I can see everything, hence after you finish the transfer, I will get a notification right away(trojan virus of mine uses a remote-control feature, which functions similarly to TeamViewer).*That I will still distribute your videos although you make the funds transfer.- My word, I have no intention or interest in continuing making your life troublesome.Anyway, If I truly wanted that, it would happen long time ago without me notifying you!Everything can be settled in a peaceful and just way!And lastly... make sure you don't get caught afterwards in such type of incidents anymore!My fair advice – ensure you change all your passwords on a regular basis.",

I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.

That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.\r<br/> <br/>This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.\r<br/>In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet: 12djMjPKd6Bv2BaXUNVuAjnuusKA66qCkX\r<br/> <br/>You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>Things you need to avoid from doing:\r<br/>*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).\r<br/>*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. \r<br/>*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.\r<br/>*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.\r<br/> <br/>Things you don't need to worry about:\r<br/>*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.\r<br/>- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).\r<br/>*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.\r<br/>- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life.
