Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.\r<br/> <br/>With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.\r<br/>This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.\r<br/> <br/>I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.\r<br/>Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.\r<br/>I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.\r<br/> <br/>All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").\r<br/> <br/>My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1\r<br/> <br/>After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.\r<br/>You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.\r<br/>Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.\r<br/> <br/>Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.\r<br/>I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake. \r<br/> <br/>If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.\n</div>",

Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",
