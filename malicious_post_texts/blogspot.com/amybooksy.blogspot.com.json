Tichelaar Award for Best Historical Fiction</strong>\n\nWhen Franco, a weary Italian soldier who’s seen some of the worst of World War I, stumbles onto the Martellino vineyard, he’s looking for work — not love. But he finds that and much more with Isabella, the feisty young woman who works there.\n\nFranco pours himself into the vineyard, trying to create a wine that will save it from financial ruin and rescue him from his dark memories of war. But it’s not easy when Mussolini's evil shadow continues to loom over all of Italy. It’s even harder when Susanna, the vineyard’s matriarch, invites that shadow to the vineyard with her involvement in Fascist politics — and one very sinister political operative.\n\nInfluenced by the teachings of A Course In Miracles, The Walls of Lucca is historical fiction that shows readers the power of love and forgiveness in the face of evil. Compelling, colorful characters populate an authentic, inspiring story of friendship, faith, love and loss in a tumultuous time in European history.\n<br/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Walls-Lucca-1-Steve-Physioc/dp/1983749524/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> | <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-walls-of-lucca-steve-physioc/1128405165?ean=9780692177792\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Barnes and Noble</a> | <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781983749520\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IndieBound</a></span></h4>\n<h3>\nPraise for The Walls of Lucca</h3>\n“An absorbing, well-researched saga.” — Kirkus Reviews\n\n“The Walls of Lucca is a tender, suspenseful and touching story sure to please fans of romance, political stories, and historical novels.” — BlueInk Review\n\n\"Author Steve Physioc has really managed to find the perfect balance of romance and real life.\" - Readers' Favorite\n\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-15101\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8MxIN09IndDB_W_ms8gKu5bUadJeapsSTVDtcxTKj_YMn25j59YEcqQw_DX5R9cTxWTy2t7EiYlvWxMoiZ1rjH9DUqUkTMEDp56MO00Mst-SRa6dI41CLMpRCyEAb1JmgDs5T1xBhlPU9_tgE0MKM3VwE-Y=s0-d\"/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\nAbove the Walls by Steve Physioc</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\nPublication Date: February 1, 2019</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\neBook &amp; Paperback; 484 Pages</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\nGenre: Historical Fiction</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43566022-above-the-walls\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-10765 size-full\" height=\"41\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8MxwzoaXE-prL9bV8cy_Mp-Zdy112GpQFJ16ZItcDenqyv2LH7YC4YUdbOhCB85PgVbBIkiCz3hmOKLFDCq3toY3KrAuWNEv9jB2vItgPfvlbOFvdXRGqno2ENNlZnEqLn-qKHeADaoWhDNOwtdp_Yo=s0-d\" width=\"130\"/></a></div>\nFor eight years, the Fascist politician Alfredo Obizzi has kept quiet about his affair with Susanna Martellino, the matriarch of the Martellino vineyard. Now in 1938 Italy, Obizzi uses his growing political power to seek revenge on his past enemies, and Susanna and the vineyard’s spiritual sage, Isabella, are at the top of his list. Will faith and forgiveness be enough to lead the vineyard and its inhabitants through the bloodshed and heartbreak of World War II and Obizzi’s vengeance?\n\nMeanwhile, the vineyard’s next generation, DeAngelo and Lily, have been best friends since they were born.

Mr Physioc’s talent shines through in this book and I thought it was pretty good. I loved getting to know Isabella. I admired her strength, bravery and determination. I found it interesting to learn a little bit what it would have been like to live in Italy post World War I.The Walls of Lucca was getting four and a half stars from me. I look forward to the sequel to the Martellino series, Above the Walls, to see what happens next.I received this book from the publisher. This review is 100% my own honest opinion.",

There were a few moments I found myself laughing out loud and others I wanted to cry. I think this was a good lighthearted and easy to read story and I recommend it for those who love Amish fiction.<br/><br/>Four stars.<br/><br/>I received this book from the publisher, but was not required to write a review.
