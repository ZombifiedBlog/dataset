I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.\r<br/> <br/>This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.\r<br/>In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1665CsfFELrfiiubFZtLsGHGuqbUz1wXcz\r<br/> <br/>You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>Things you need to avoid from doing:\r<br/>*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).\r<br/>*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. \r<br/>*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.\r<br/>*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.\r<br/> <br/>Things you don't need to worry about:\r<br/>*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.\r<br/>- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).\r<br/>*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.\r<br/>- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life.
