You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9CAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

( ^_~)Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.We can still resolve it in the following manner:You perform a transfer of $1490 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1Bg62SYMjRfcSVaUM9VoAcr8Fy6bX2qQbNYou are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay.> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

How are you? \r<br/> <br/>I know, it's unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.\r<br/>Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.\r<br/>Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.\r<br/> <br/>Here is the history of how it could become possible: \r<br/>At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).\r<br/>As result, I could easily log in to your email account (<a href=\"mailto:elonushka.mama@blogger.com\">elonushka.mama@blogger.com</a>).\r<br/> <br/>One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.\r<br/>Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).\r<br/>Everything ingenious is quite simple. (0_o)!\r<br/> <br/>My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.\r<br/>I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.\r<br/>I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.\r<br/>Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.\r<br/> <br/>Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.\r<br/> <br/>As I was gathering information about you, I couldn't help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.\r<br/>You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.\r<br/>I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.\r<br/> <br/>If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions, \r<br/>it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.\r<br/>I can also make those vids become accessible by public.\r<br/>I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch, \r<br/>(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.\r<br/> <br/>However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:\r<br/>Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1340 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer), \r<br/>and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.\r<br/>After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well. \r<br/>Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.\r<br/> <br/>This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.\r<br/>If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process - it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: 1JfnsTBvRQYNvzxYFTQBtEUgojmPy2vd6F\r<br/> <br/>You should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.\r<br/> <br/>The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:\r<br/>#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).\r<br/>#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends. \r<br/> After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) - your kinky video will end up being available to public right away. \r<br/>#Do not try searching for me - there is absolutely no reason to do that.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi. How are you?I know, it's unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.Here is the history of how it could become possible:At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).As result, I could easily log in to your email account (elonushka.mama@blogger.com).One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).Everything ingenious is quite simple. (0_o)!My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.As I was gathering information about you, I couldn't help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.I can also make those vids become accessible by public.I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1340 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process - it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: 1JfnsTBvRQYNvzxYFTQBtEUgojmPy2vd6FYou should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) - your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.#Do not try searching for me - there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.The following list contains things you should not be worried about:#That your money won't reach my account.- Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.- Trust me, it's pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!Let's make this deal in a fair manner!Owh, one more thing...in future it is best that you don't involve yourself in similar situations any longer!One last advice from me - recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.",

In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.\r<br/> <br/>That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.\r<br/>If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1Dwi3dsfYEzbU3QDtjNC8DNfoaVNAcNRYC\r<br/> <br/>You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).\r<br/> <br/>Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately. \r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them.

Includingelonushka.mama@blogger.com.It is easy to check - I wrote you this email from your account.Moreover, I know your intim secret, and I have proof of this.You do not know me personally, and no one paid me to check you.It is just a coincidence that I discovered your mistake.In fact, I posted a malicious code (exploit) to an adult site, and you visited this site...While watching a video Trojan virus has been installed on your device through an exploit.This darknet software working as RDP (remote-controlled desktop), which has a keylogger,which gave me access to your microphone and webcam.Soon after, my software received all your contacts from your messenger, social network and email.At that moment I spent much more time than I should have.I studied your love life and created a good video series.The first part shows the video that you watched,and the second part shows the video clip taken from your webcam (you are doing inappropriate things).Honestly, I want to forget all the information about you and allow you to continue your daily life.And I will give you two suitable options. Both are easy to do.First option: you ignore this email.The second option: you pay me $750(USD).Let's look at 2 options in detail.The first option is to ignore this email.Let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.I will send your video to your contacts, including family members, colleagues, etc.This does not protect you from the humiliation that you andyour family need to know when friends and family members know about your unpleasant details.The second option is to pay me. We will call this \"privacy advice.\"Now let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.Your secret is your secret. I immediately destroy the video.You continue your life as if none of this has happened.Now you might think: \"I'll call to police!\"Undoubtedly, I have taken steps to ensure that this letter cannot be traced to me,and it will not remain aloof from the evidence of the destruction of your daily life.I don't want to steal all your savings.I just want to get compensation for my efforts that I put in to investigate you.Let us hope that you decide to create all this in full and pay me a fee for confidentiality.You make a Bitcoin payment (if you don't know how to do it, just enter \"how to buy bitcoins\" in Google search)Shipping amount: $750(USD).Getting Bitcoin Addresses: 1GF8J1XRaiX2oHM7SQo9VAFAtWZcRgMncg(This is sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully)Don't tell anyone what to use bitcoins for. The procedure for obtaining bitcoins can take several days, so do not wait.I have a spetial code in Trojan, and now I know that you have read this letter.You have 48 hours to pay.If I don't get BitCoins, I'll send your video to your contacts, including close relatives, co-workers, and so on.Start looking for the best excuse for friends and family before they all know.But if I get paid, I immediately delete the video.This is a one-time offer that is non-negotiable, so do not waste my and your time.Time is running out.Bye!",
