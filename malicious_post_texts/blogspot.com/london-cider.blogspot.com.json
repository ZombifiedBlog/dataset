I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing.
