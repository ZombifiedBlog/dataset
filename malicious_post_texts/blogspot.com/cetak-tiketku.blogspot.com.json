Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.\r<br/>Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1750 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it's not very difficult.\r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1HiTbewnp8XNHy2zdeYQTG3NAicRG7CzuT\r<br/> <br/>You have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/> <br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi!Unfortunately, I have some bad news for you.Several months ago, I got access to the device you are using to browse the internet.Since that time, I have been monitoring your internet activity.Being a regular visitor of adult websites, I can confirm that it is you who is responsible for this.To keep it simple, the websites you visited provided me with access to your data.I've uploaded a Trojan horse on the driver basis that updates its signature several times per day, to make it impossible for antivirus to detect it. Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1750 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it's not very difficult.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1HiTbewnp8XNHy2zdeYQTG3NAicRG7CzuTYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that, the video will be posted on the web!P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",

It is a reminder about your dirty deeds!\r<br/> <br/>It has been around 4 months since your device that you use to access the internet, has been infected with spyware.\r<br/>I have been tracking your online activities for a long time by now.\r<br/> <br/>How it has become possible:\r<br/>Approximately half a year ago there was a huge leak of personal data (mainly passwords and logins), including your email provider (<a href=\"//blogger.com\">blogger.com</a>).\r<br/>Professional hackers have used this data in order to access the operating systems of potential victims (including you as well), \r<br/>and installed special loaders that can be used to install absolutely anything to the infected devices.\r<br/> <br/>I would like to point out that antivirus companies are struggling to deal with such spyware since long time ago, \r<br/>because Trojan software codes keep continuously updating and hence, not allowing antiviruses to do anything.\r<br/> <br/>Likewise, all that personal data has become available at the black market and I have purchased it to install my spyware and start checking out people's personal information,\r<br/>hoping to find something interesting.\r<br/>Some people had a lot of boring documents, some people have basic games, while others play casino... all those devices have been utilized by us in order to do cryptocurrency mining.\r<br/>However, eventually I have stumbled upon something really special while checking your personal data!\r<br/> <br/>You are truly a huge fan of watching kinky videos (it is easy to confirm by checking the activity log of your multimedia players and browser history).\r<br/>I have been filtering out for some time the most shocking videos with you masturbating, while recording you via your device's camera and microphone.\r<br/>As result, I have generated sample videos exposing the way you are pleasing yourself (in really impressive manners sometimes), \r<br/>while the lower part of the screen plays the video that you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/> <br/>I have managed to create a really nice collection for the past few months!\r<br/>What do you think would happen, if those videos get shared to your colleagues, relatives and friends?\r<br/>Taking in consideration the \"specificity\" of the videos you had been watching, the opinion of your friends about your personality will be changed once and for all.\r<br/>I guess, you might have troubles with law due to certain videos from that collection...\r<br/>But I don't want to get you in this kind of troubles, since I have no interest in that.\r<br/> <br/>I simply want to get some money from you, since I have spent quite a significant amount of time and effort to get all this done!\r<br/>Let's agree like this: 1550$ (USD) of bitcoin equivalent will be good enough for me! If you want to pay more - please, feel free!\r<br/> <br/>My BTC wallet for your transaction is: 199ZxJd71PJkMjjTdQdh7ekmQ2amE1tVe6\r<br/> <br/>It is really not that hard to purchase bitcoin and send it to my wallet. Based on the logs, I can say that you are not a stupid person and really known how to use the internet. \r<br/>Frankly speaking, I can't imagine where else this kind of videos (with you masturbating) can be found. ;)\r<br/> <br/>Once I receive a notification of your transaction, I will immediately delete your kinky videos right away together with the porn that you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/>Afterwards, I will completely forget about you - don't worry, you are not the only one like that!\r<br/> <br/>By the way, you have no idea how many there are people around the globe that watch porn, while masturbating. \r<br/>However, those guys don't watch such kinky videos with nasty models that your like to watch!!!\r<br/>Likewise, regardless of everything mentioned above, there is no reason for you to panic! \r<br/> <br/>Here are several simple rules for you to end it all in the most problem-free manner:\r<br/># You have 48 hours to complete the bitcoin transaction. If I don't receive any money from you after 48 hours, \r<br/> then I will upload the videoclip exposing you to online resources and forward it to your entire contact list.\r<br/> Even your closest relatives, colleagues and friends will receive an email or SMS from me. \r<br/> You've got to complete everything necessary within the allocated time - I won't be waiting any longer that that!\r<br/># Timer will start automatically right after you open this email. Please note, that even though the email gets opened by somebody else, the timer will still start.\r<br/># There is no point to reply this email. The sender address has been generated - I have merely used a random address from the internet.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!This email has nothing good for you. It is a reminder about your dirty deeds!It has been around 4 months since your device that you use to access the internet, has been infected with spyware.I have been tracking your online activities for a long time by now.How it has become possible:Approximately half a year ago there was a huge leak of personal data (mainly passwords and logins), including your email provider (blogger.com).Professional hackers have used this data in order to access the operating systems of potential victims (including you as well),and installed special loaders that can be used to install absolutely anything to the infected devices.I would like to point out that antivirus companies are struggling to deal with such spyware since long time ago,because Trojan software codes keep continuously updating and hence, not allowing antiviruses to do anything.Likewise, all that personal data has become available at the black market and I have purchased it to install my spyware and start checking out people's personal information,hoping to find something interesting.Some people had a lot of boring documents, some people have basic games, while others play casino... all those devices have been utilized by us in order to do cryptocurrency mining.However, eventually I have stumbled upon something really special while checking your personal data!You are truly a huge fan of watching kinky videos (it is easy to confirm by checking the activity log of your multimedia players and browser history).I have been filtering out for some time the most shocking videos with you masturbating, while recording you via your device's camera and microphone.As result, I have generated sample videos exposing the way you are pleasing yourself (in really impressive manners sometimes),while the lower part of the screen plays the video that you were watching at that point of time.I have managed to create a really nice collection for the past few months!What do you think would happen, if those videos get shared to your colleagues, relatives and friends?Taking in consideration the \"specificity\" of the videos you had been watching, the opinion of your friends about your personality will be changed once and for all.I guess, you might have troubles with law due to certain videos from that collection...But I don't want to get you in this kind of troubles, since I have no interest in that.I simply want to get some money from you, since I have spent quite a significant amount of time and effort to get all this done!Let's agree like this: 1550$ (USD) of bitcoin equivalent will be good enough for me! If you want to pay more - please, feel free!My BTC wallet for your transaction is: 199ZxJd71PJkMjjTdQdh7ekmQ2amE1tVe6It is really not that hard to purchase bitcoin and send it to my wallet. Based on the logs, I can say that you are not a stupid person and really known how to use the internet.Frankly speaking, I can't imagine where else this kind of videos (with you masturbating) can be found. ;)Once I receive a notification of your transaction, I will immediately delete your kinky videos right away together with the porn that you were watching at that point of time.Afterwards, I will completely forget about you - don't worry, you are not the only one like that!By the way, you have no idea how many there are people around the globe that watch porn, while masturbating.However, those guys don't watch such kinky videos with nasty models that your like to watch!!!Likewise, regardless of everything mentioned above, there is no reason for you to panic!Here are several simple rules for you to end it all in the most problem-free manner:# You have 48 hours to complete the bitcoin transaction. If I don't receive any money from you after 48 hours,then I will upload the videoclip exposing you to online resources and forward it to your entire contact list.Even your closest relatives, colleagues and friends will receive an email or SMS from me.You've got to complete everything necessary within the allocated time - I won't be waiting any longer that that!# Timer will start automatically right after you open this email. Please note, that even though the email gets opened by somebody else, the timer will still start.# There is no point to reply this email. The sender address has been generated - I have merely used a random address from the internet. All you need to do is pay.# In case if you decide to find me - that is a bad idea, since I am using nodes, same as blockchain system, which are used to carry out bitcoin transactions.# The idea to reinstall the Operating System would not help either. Even if you burn down your device, it still won't solve the problem.All the files have already been encrypted and saved at remote file hosting websites.# Once the transaction is complete, there is no need to notify me about that. I will be able to see it by myself, since I am monitoring all your online activities.Please keep in mind the most important thing:Once you complete the transaction, I will delete my Trojan virus from your device as well as all the discrediting videos from remote online resources.Afterwards, you can forget about me and this unpleasant situation as well. That is the best solution to this problem!One last advice for you: change all the access information to all your online services, since I may be not only one who has the access to all your accounts!Please be reasonable.Good luck!",

Virus menempati ruangan dalam media penyimpanan  (misalnya, melekat pada <em>file</em> atau tersimpan dalam <em>boot sector hard disk</em>) dan  umumnya menyebar melalui USB <em>flash disk</em>, lampiran (<em>attachment</em>) <em>email</em>, berkas (<em>file</em>) yang diunduh dari internet, maupun melalui kunjungan ke  halaman <em>website</em> yang sengaja dibuat untuk menyebarkan virus.

Pengguna komputer ditipu untuk  melakukan tindakan yang dapat   menyebarkan trojan, misalnya membuka lampiran itu  karena mengira itu   adalah <em>file</em> Excel biasa padahal sebenarnya berisi program  <em>trojan</em>.</p>  Setelah berhasil menginfeksi komputer, <em>trojan</em> dapat bertindak merusak seperti <em>virus</em> lain atau mengirim informasi penting,  termasuk <em>User ID</em> dan <em>password</em>, ke pihak lain tanpa sepengetahuan pemakai  komputer yang terinfeksi.<strong><br/> </strong></li></ul> <ul><li><strong><em>Spyware</em></strong><br/><br/> <p><em>Spyware</em> adalah sejenis   komputer program yang dibuat untuk 'mencuri' informasi-informasi    penting/Pribadi dari komputer yang terinfeksi dan mengirimnya ke lokasi    tertentu di internet untuk kemudian diambil oleh pembuatnya. Informasi   yang  menjadi target utama contohnya: nomor kartu kredit, <em>User </em>ID dan PIN/<em>password</em>,  nomor rekening, alamat<em> email</em>, dan lain-lain. </p> <p><em>Spyware</em> dapat ter-<em>install</em> melalui <em>email attachment</em>, program yang di-<em>install</em> dari  sumber-sumber yang tidak jelas, ataupun oleh <em>website</em> yang 'jahat'. </p>    Namun, berbeda dengan virus yang sifatnya lebih  merusak, <em>spyware</em>   bekerja secara diam-diam agar tidak terlacak sehingga lebih  mudah   mengumpulkan informasi yang diinginkan sang pembuat/penyebar <em>spyware</em>. <br/> </li></ul> <ul><li><strong><em>Bot (roBot)</em></strong><em><br/> </em><br/> <p><em>Bot</em> adalah sejenis   komputer program yang dapat menyebabkan komputer dikontrol oleh  orang   lain secara remote melalui jaringan.

Senapan M16    memuaskan petinggi militer AS untuk mengembangkan senapan serbu yang    ringan untuk menggantikan M1 dan M14. Fitur inovatifnya meliputi bahan    campuran plastik dan logam ringan, sistem reload (mengisi ulang peluru)    yang mudah dan penggunaan peluru kaliber 5.56mm.<br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8Mzp1z65fgqKgUNMO0XjXe1rsuHncAIHtFdZ6Tmdu1sNl5_y7GvILUJ7OFOIRr_LuAcpH621y8dKiPWWK-o4ni6R7efQcwlDpqoSYlpKR6hGSNTmBSSJg3YBZ70HQp94AiGd80JQgZkgv72HyuTLyOY=s0-d\" width=\"320\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8MwpRDNf6OnpPLMGkQkxAGl8nHDMhUGMrtNhTJrWdG8ox7-bAFsOOeCR6ELHlgr9l0ObTLMLFJ_CEs94TUE_pzje_uWobRFNNLn0NMMYjymlAaKvBbbnmjcb9DchNOFgk09UvTx2=s0-d\" width=\"320\"/><br/> <b><br/><span>3.

Magasinnya    membawa 10 peluru, jumlah terbanyak dari senapan apapun di 50 tahun awal    abad 20. Bolt actionnya terkokang saat menutup, dan kepala larasnya    mencegah debu dan lumpur masuk ke dalam senapan. Di tangan tentara yang    terlatih dengan baik, Lee-Enfield bisa melakukan apa yang disebut \"mad    minute,\" yaitu, 30 peluru menembak target pada jarak 200 meter dalam    satu menit. Jumlah tembakan yang menandingi senapan semi otomatis    modern.<br/><b><br/><span>4.

Jendral Patton mengatakan di    akhir Perang Dunia II M1 Garand adalah peralatan perang paling hebat    yang pernah diciptakan. Walaupun terdapat sedikit cacat, tidak diragukan    lagi M1 Garand adalah senapan semi otomatis pertama yang sukses dan    akurasi M1 Garand mendominasi medan perang. Lebih dari 6 juta senapan    dibuat pada masa itu dan dihentikan masa tugasnya di akhir 1960.<br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"61\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8Mxg27qz3gsvxPCru0Y6RPCec--f9QFQPx9mhJJOD_77bOw8JkHtW8-fF-Cow8HJ0V181EOOcJ0iiv-ihw7VMcququzJPQwEmlUskzAjDKp9Bvq2KmbcNvf_x7DLm-Uj8fg=s0-d\" width=\"320\"/><br/><br/><b><span>5.

Namun ketika NATO    mengeluarkan kebutuhan peluru standar 7.62 mm, FN merombak desainnya dan    membuat senapan yang bisa diisi banyak peluru dan kuat. FN FAL dengan    segera menjadi senjata klasik selama perang dingin, digunakan oleh 50    negara biarpun FAL susah ditembakkan bila menggunakan mode full auto.    Senapan ini memberikan pelayanan bagus pada tentara Australia pada    perang Vietnam, pada tentara Israel selama perang 6 hari and dan    digunakan oleh Inggris dan Argentina pada perang Falklands.<br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8MyBo_vyhpnClFeP4rqst93PKCS7b5QUJ-6wOwOHiFFMmJSKb69Fy5dLdK52nWlR7gM4EReoBKl-KIq-VcPM0NAQpO5tCW96zuEAYYaUFUD1dYgXLx-J6-4x7SqQZooQJLIh=s0-d\" width=\"320\"/><br/><b><br/><span>6.

Model   aslinya  digunakan selama perang dunia 1 dan menghasilkan efek yang   besar,  tetapi ketika Jerman mulai mempersenjatai ulang pada tahun   1930-an,  senapan 98 mendapat upgrade yang membuat lenih ringan dan   lebih mudah  dibidik.

        "cleaned_post_text": "1. AK-47Type: Semi or Fully Automatic Assault RifleCountry of Origin: Soviet UnionCaliber: 7.62 x 39 mm (.30 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 30 roundsMuzzle Velocity: 2,329 feet per secondRate of Fire: 600 rounds per minuteDengan produksi lebih dari 75 juta di seluruh dunia, AK-47 (a.k.a.,    \"Kalashnikov\") adalah senjata api legendaris yang mungkin memberi    kerusakan paling mematikan daripada seluruh senjata api apapun. Dibuat    dengan desain yang sama dengan StG.44, AK-47 diisi dengan peluru 7.62 mm    dan dibuat dari bagian yang dirakit. AK-47 tidak hanya mudah   diproduksi  dan murah, tetapi juga mudah dirawat dan \"kebal\" terhadap   kondisi yang  bisa merusak senjata lainnya. Akurasinya tidak terlalu   bagus, tapi AK-47  menggantinya dengan kemampuannya melepaskan serangan   mematikan.2. M16Type: Semi or Fully Automatic Assault RifleCountry of Origin: United StatesCaliber: 5.56 x 45 mm (.223 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 20-30 roundsMuzzle Velocity: Approximately 3,281 feet per secondRate of Fire: 700-950 rounds per minuteWalaupun    butuh waktu mengatasi masalah kemacetan senapan sewaktu latihan    bertempur di awal 1960, M16 membuktikan kehandalannya lewat akurasi,    penanganan, masa digunakan, serta keefektifan dalam perang. Senapan M16    memuaskan petinggi militer AS untuk mengembangkan senapan serbu yang    ringan untuk menggantikan M1 dan M14. Fitur inovatifnya meliputi bahan    campuran plastik dan logam ringan, sistem reload (mengisi ulang peluru)    yang mudah dan penggunaan peluru kaliber 5.56mm.3. LEE-ENFIELD SMLEType: Bolt-Action RifleCountry of Origin: United KingdomCaliber: 7.7 x 56 mm (.30 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 10 roundsMuzzle Velocity: approximately 2,438 feet per secondRate of Fire: 15-20 rounds per minuteSenapan    standar infantri Inggris dari Perang Dunia I hingga krisis Suez,    Lee-Enfield SMLE (baca: \"smelly\") membangun reputasinya dari akurasi,    kehandalan, serta jumlah tembakan per menit yang fenomenal. Magasinnya    membawa 10 peluru, jumlah terbanyak dari senapan apapun di 50 tahun awal    abad 20. Bolt actionnya terkokang saat menutup, dan kepala larasnya    mencegah debu dan lumpur masuk ke dalam senapan. Di tangan tentara yang    terlatih dengan baik, Lee-Enfield bisa melakukan apa yang disebut \"mad    minute,\" yaitu, 30 peluru menembak target pada jarak 200 meter dalam    satu menit. Jumlah tembakan yang menandingi senapan semi otomatis    modern.4. M1 GARANDType: SemiautomaticRifle Country of Origin: United StatesCaliber: 7.62 x 63 mm (.30-06 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 8 roundsMuzzle Velocity: Approximately 2,838 feet per secondRate of Fire: 30 rounds per minuteDiadopsi    oeh angkatan bersenjata AS pada tahun 1936, M1 Garand terbukti menjadi    senapan yang tangguh 5 tahun kemudian. Jendral Patton mengatakan di    akhir Perang Dunia II M1 Garand adalah peralatan perang paling hebat    yang pernah diciptakan. Walaupun terdapat sedikit cacat, tidak diragukan    lagi M1 Garand adalah senapan semi otomatis pertama yang sukses dan    akurasi M1 Garand mendominasi medan perang. Lebih dari 6 juta senapan    dibuat pada masa itu dan dihentikan masa tugasnya di akhir 1960.5. FN FALType: Semi or Fully Automatic RifleCountry of Origin: BelgiumCaliber: 7.62 x 51 mm (.30 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 20 roundsMuzzle Velocity: Approximately 2,700 feet per secondRate of Fire: 650-700 rounds per minuteTerinspirasi    oleh StG.44, Pabrik senjata Belgia, Fabrique Nationale (FN)    mengembangkan FAL yang pelurunya sama dengan StG.44. Namun ketika NATO    mengeluarkan kebutuhan peluru standar 7.62 mm, FN merombak desainnya dan    membuat senapan yang bisa diisi banyak peluru dan kuat. FN FAL dengan    segera menjadi senjata klasik selama perang dingin, digunakan oleh 50    negara biarpun FAL susah ditembakkan bila menggunakan mode full auto.    Senapan ini memberikan pelayanan bagus pada tentara Australia pada    perang Vietnam, pada tentara Israel selama perang 6 hari and dan    digunakan oleh Inggris dan Argentina pada perang Falklands.6. MAUSER K98k CARBINEType: Bolt-Action RifleCountry of Origin: GermanyCaliber: 7.92 x 57 mm (.30 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 5 roundsMuzzle Velocity: approximately 2,822 feet per secondRate of Fire: 10-15 rounds per minutePertama    kali diproduksi pada akhir abad 19, Mauser 98 adalah gabungan sempurna    dari inovasi senapan yang berlangsung di akhir abad 19: serbuk mesiu    tanpa asap, bisa diisi dengan magasin, dan terutama, fitur 'bolt action'    dimana menjadi dasar senapan berburu pada jaman sekarang. Model   aslinya  digunakan selama perang dunia 1 dan menghasilkan efek yang   besar,  tetapi ketika Jerman mulai mempersenjatai ulang pada tahun   1930-an,  senapan 98 mendapat upgrade yang membuat lenih ringan dan   lebih mudah  dibidik. Walaupun tidak dapat dihindari bahwa senjata ini   dikalahkan  oleh senapan otomatis, senapan ini bertahan sebagai senjata   terbaik  sepanjang masa.7. STEYR AUGType: Semi or Fully Automatic Bull-Pup Assault RifleCountry of Origin: AustriaCaliber: 5.56 x 45 mm (.22 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 30 and 42 roundsMuzzle Velocity: Approximately 3,084 feet per secondRate of Fire: 650 rounds per minuteMencari    senjata yang lebih mirip di film-film sains fiksi, \"cacat\" paling    serius dari Steyr AUG adalah bentuknya yang menakuti pembeli potensial    setalah dikenalkan tahun 1977. Dalam konfigurasi \"Bull-pup\" yang radikal    ini, hampir semua sistemnya berada di belakang pelatuk, dan hasilnya    adalah senjata yang ringkas dan mudah digunakan.8. 1903 SPRINGFIELDType: Bolt-Action RifleCountry of Origin: United StatesCaliber: 7.62 x 63 mm (.30-06 inch)Cartridge Capacity: 5 roundsMuzzle Velocity: Approximately 2,700 feet per secondRate of Fire: 10 rounds per minutePerforma    buruk pada senapan Norwegia Krag-Jorgensen yang dipakai tentara AS   pada  perang Amerika-Spanyol membuat para perancang senjata mencari lagi    senjata standar infantri. Mereka \"meminjam\"senapan Jerman, 7mm Mauser,    menambah sedikit modifikasi, dan menciptakan senapan yang bermagasin,    yang secara fenomenal menambah akurasi. 1903 dengan cepat mendapat    reputasi sebagai senjata api yang akurat dan kuat – pada perang di hutan    Belleau pada tahun 1918, Marinir AS bersenjatakan 1903 springfield    memotong serangan balasan musuh dari jarak 700-800 yards. Senapan ini    terus digunakan pada Perang dunia II, perang Korea, bahkan sebagai    senapan sniper pada perang Vietnam.9.

Hewan-hewan  bisa jadi  \"senjata biologis\" karena kemampuan mereka, paling  tidak  pada saat itu,  tidak dapat disamai oleh kemampuan mesin. Berikut  ini  adalah sejumlah  hewan yang seringkali dimanfaatkan dalam konflik.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Kelelawar</b></span><br/> <span><img alt=\"http://antaratv.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/bat1.gif\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AAOd8MwztKzqTVeLkpZkN4rSMB7zi0L04J2dszKbKZ_vmRgkejrN2ldFm-q0643KPXOnX1CRPStGOY77VjH-0AHV76HmQ8RRSgmjSx37jwbZlNaRJPZ4dG3nOLY=s0-d\" style=\"height: 371px; width: 374px;\"/></span><br/> <span>Kemarahan   Amerika Serikat atas serangan Jepang ke Pearl Harbor  menelurkan ide   memasang bom di kelelawar. Percikan api diharapkan  dapat dipicu untuk   membakar kota-kota Jepang saat kelelawar ini  bertengger di atap   bangunan. Namun rencana ini batal, karena dalam  pengujian banyak   kelelawar tidak kooperatif dan kabur. Hingga kini,  ilmuwan Pentagon   masih mempelajari bagaimana mekanisme terbang  kelelawar ini untuk   mengembangkan desain pesawat dan robot mata-mata.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Unta</b></span><br/> <span><img alt=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VhXkErfaYwU/S-emLFa1klI/AAAAAAAAAeA/CIH2L-AFdGk/s400/camel.jpg\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_VhXkErfaYwU/S-emLFa1klI/AAAAAAAAAeA/CIH2L-AFdGk/s400/camel.jpg\"/></span><br/> <span>Di   masa lampau, hewan ini banyak digunakan d<a href=\"http://unikboss.blogspot.com/\" style=\"color:black\">i</a>  kawasan panas dan kering di   Afrika Utara dan Timur Tengah. Karena  unta memiliki kemampuan bertahan   di kondisi ekstrem dan seringkali  tanpa air, di masa perang hewan ini   cukup berguna. Bau unta kabarnya  membuat takut kuda-kuda yang digunakan   musuh. Tentara Persia terkadang  mempersenjatai unta mereka. Sedangkan   prajurit Arab seringkal<a href=\"http://unikboss.blogspot.com/\" style=\"color:black\">i</a>  menunggang unta saat penyerbuan untuk   menaklukan suatu daerah. Peran  unta dalam perang merosot sejak   berkembangnya senjata api. Tapi, unta  masih terlihat digunakan saat   Perang Dunia I.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Lebah</b></span><br/> <span>Sengat  lebah bisa jadi senjata  mematikan. Di zaman dulu, tentara R<a href=\"http://unikboss.blogspot.com/\" style=\"color:black\">o</a>ma  dan  Yunani menggunakan lebah  untuk menghalangi musuh. Penggunaan  lebah  berlanjut saat abad  pertengahan, Perang Dunia I, dan Perang  Vietnam.  Ilmuwan Amerika Serikat  juga menemukan kegunaan lebah untuk  tujuan  damai, yakni mendeteksi  ranjau darat.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Singa laut</b></span><br/> <span>Mamalia  ini mampu melihat  dalam kondisi cahaya minimal serta  bisa mendengar di  bawah permukaan  air. Singa laut juga bisa berenang  dengan kecepatan  hingga 40 km/jam dan  menyelam hingga kedalaman 300  meter. Dengan  kemampuan ini, angkatan  laut AS melatih singa laut untuk  menandai  ranjau.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Merpati</b></span><br/> <span>Hewan   ini memiliki kemampuan navigasi sehingga bisa kembali ke  sarang   meskipun telah menempuh perjalanan ratusan kilometer. Puncak  kepopuleran   penggunaan merpati terjadi pada saat Perang Dunia I, saat  tentara   sekutu menggunakan 200.000 merpati untuk keperluan komunikasi.  Seekor   Merpati bernama Cher Ami mendapat penghargaan setelah mengirim  12 pesan   untuk benteng di Verdun, Prancis. Bangsa burung pensiun dari  tugas   militer setelah teknologi komunikasi berkembang pesat.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Lumba-Lumba</b></span><br/> <span>Hewan   ini memiliki sonar biologis untuk mencari ranja<a href=\"http://unikboss.blogspot.com/\" style=\"color:black\">u</a>  berdasarkan konsep   gema. Pada masa Perang Teluk dan Perang Irak,  lumba-lumba milik angkatan   laut membantu membersihkan pelabuhan Umm  Qasr dari ranjau.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Gajah</b></span><br/> <span>Hewan   besar ini bisa menginjak tentara, menusukkan gad<a href=\"http://unikboss.blogspot.com/\" style=\"color:black\">i</a>ng,  dan melempar  orang  dengan belalainya. Kerajaan kuno di India  diperkirakan menjadi  kerajaan  pertama yang menjinakkan gajah. Tapi,  kemampuan ini segera  menyebar ke  Persia dan Timur Tengah. Alexander  Agung dikabarkan pernah  menemui  sepasukan gajah saat mencoba  menaklukan suatu daerah. Kuda  seringkali  takut dengan pemandangan dan  bau Gajah. Tentara manusia juga  merasa  diteror secara psikologis  dengan bentuk Gajah yang sangat  besar.</span><br/> <br/> <span><b>Keledai</b></span><br/> <span>Tidak   sehebat hewan perang lainnya, tapi ribuan pasukan akan  menderita jika   tak ada Keledai. Pasalnya, hewan inilah yang didaulat  membawa makanan,   bahkan persenjataan dan barang-barang lain yang  dibutuhkan militer.   Dulu, tentara Roma membawa satu Keledai tiap 10  legiun. Napoleon   Bonaperte juga menaiki keledai saat melintasi Alpen.  Keledai masih   sering mendapat tugas militer hingga saat ini.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Para   kesatria di atas kuda bisa merusak formasi pasukan musuh.  lumba-lumba   angkatan laut membantu membersihkan Pelabuhan Umm Qasr dari  ranjau.   tentara Roma dan Yunani menggunakan lebah untuk menghalangi  musuh.Itulah  sebagian hewan yang digunakan dalam perang.  Hewan-hewan  bisa jadi  \"senjata biologis\" karena kemampuan mereka, paling  tidak  pada saat itu,  tidak dapat disamai oleh kemampuan mesin. Berikut  ini  adalah sejumlah  hewan yang seringkali dimanfaatkan dalam konflik.KelelawarKemarahan   Amerika Serikat atas serangan Jepang ke Pearl Harbor  menelurkan ide   memasang bom di kelelawar. Percikan api diharapkan  dapat dipicu untuk   membakar kota-kota Jepang saat kelelawar ini  bertengger di atap   bangunan. Namun rencana ini batal, karena dalam  pengujian banyak   kelelawar tidak kooperatif dan kabur. Hingga kini,  ilmuwan Pentagon   masih mempelajari bagaimana mekanisme terbang  kelelawar ini untuk   mengembangkan desain pesawat dan robot mata-mata.UntaDi   masa lampau, hewan ini banyak digunakan dikawasan panas dan kering di   Afrika Utara dan Timur Tengah. Karena  unta memiliki kemampuan bertahan   di kondisi ekstrem dan seringkali  tanpa air, di masa perang hewan ini   cukup berguna. Bau unta kabarnya  membuat takut kuda-kuda yang digunakan   musuh. Tentara Persia terkadang  mempersenjatai unta mereka. Sedangkan   prajurit Arab seringkalimenunggang unta saat penyerbuan untuk   menaklukan suatu daerah. Peran  unta dalam perang merosot sejak   berkembangnya senjata api. Tapi, unta  masih terlihat digunakan saat   Perang Dunia I.LebahSengat  lebah bisa jadi senjata  mematikan. Di zaman dulu, tentara Roma  dan  Yunani menggunakan lebah  untuk menghalangi musuh. Penggunaan  lebah  berlanjut saat abad  pertengahan, Perang Dunia I, dan Perang  Vietnam.  Ilmuwan Amerika Serikat  juga menemukan kegunaan lebah untuk  tujuan  damai, yakni mendeteksi  ranjau darat.Singa lautMamalia  ini mampu melihat  dalam kondisi cahaya minimal serta  bisa mendengar di  bawah permukaan  air. Singa laut juga bisa berenang  dengan kecepatan  hingga 40 km/jam dan  menyelam hingga kedalaman 300  meter. Dengan  kemampuan ini, angkatan  laut AS melatih singa laut untuk  menandai  ranjau.MerpatiHewan   ini memiliki kemampuan navigasi sehingga bisa kembali ke  sarang   meskipun telah menempuh perjalanan ratusan kilometer. Puncak  kepopuleran   penggunaan merpati terjadi pada saat Perang Dunia I, saat  tentara   sekutu menggunakan 200.000 merpati untuk keperluan komunikasi.  Seekor   Merpati bernama Cher Ami mendapat penghargaan setelah mengirim  12 pesan   untuk benteng di Verdun, Prancis. Bangsa burung pensiun dari  tugas   militer setelah teknologi komunikasi berkembang pesat.Lumba-LumbaHewan   ini memiliki sonar biologis untuk mencari ranjauberdasarkan konsep   gema. Pada masa Perang Teluk dan Perang Irak,  lumba-lumba milik angkatan   laut membantu membersihkan pelabuhan Umm  Qasr dari ranjau.GajahHewan   besar ini bisa menginjak tentara, menusukkan gading,  dan melempar  orang  dengan belalainya. Kerajaan kuno di India  diperkirakan menjadi  kerajaan  pertama yang menjinakkan gajah. Tapi,  kemampuan ini segera  menyebar ke  Persia dan Timur Tengah. Alexander  Agung dikabarkan pernah  menemui  sepasukan gajah saat mencoba  menaklukan suatu daerah. Kuda  seringkali  takut dengan pemandangan dan  bau Gajah. Tentara manusia juga  merasa  diteror secara psikologis  dengan bentuk Gajah yang sangat  besar.KeledaiTidak   sehebat hewan perang lainnya, tapi ribuan pasukan akan  menderita jika   tak ada Keledai. Pasalnya, hewan inilah yang didaulat  membawa makanan,   bahkan persenjataan dan barang-barang lain yang  dibutuhkan militer.   Dulu, tentara Roma membawa satu Keledai tiap 10  legiun. Napoleon   Bonaperte juga menaiki keledai saat melintasi Alpen.  Keledai masih   sering mendapat tugas militer hingga saat ini. Tentara  AS bergantung   pada hewan ini untuk mengantar barang ke pos-pos  terpencil di pegunungan   Afghanistan.AnjingOrang-orang  Spanyol menggunakan  anjing yang dipersenjataisaat menaklukan Amerika  Selatan di abad ke-16.  Anjing juga berperan  besar selama konflik di  abad pertengahan di Eropa.  Tugas anjing di  masa modern kini meliputi  mendeteksi bom dengan indera  penciuman. Di  Irak dan Afghanistan, anjing  militer dikenakan rompi  antipeluru demi  menjamin keamanan selama  bertugas.KudaNah,   ini hewan yang paling populer saat perang berlangsung.

Mereka akan segera  menandatangani kontrak kerja  produksi 20 unit N-219 oleh PT DI untuk  memenuhi kebutuhan Merpati,\"  kata Menteri BUMN Mustafa Abubakar, seusai  Rapat Kerja dengan Komisi VI  DPR, di Gedung MPR/DPR, Jakarta, Senin  (4/7). <br/><br/>Menurut Mustafa,  sinergi merupakan salah satu langkah yang harus  ditempuh sehingga  restrukturisasi yang sedang dilakukan terhadap kedua  perusahaan  tersebut mencapai hasil lebih maksimal. <br/><br/>Pada kesempatan itu  pemerintah bersama dengan Komisi VI DPR  menyetujui suntikan dana dalam  bentuk Penyertaan Modal Negara (PMN)  kepada Merpati sebesar Rp516  miliar, sedangkan PTDI diusulkan  mendapatkan PMN sekitar Rp2 triiun  dari APBN 2012. <br/><br/>Direktur Utama Merpati Sardjono Jhony  Tjitrokusumo mengakui  pihaknya membutuhkan sebanyak 20 unit pesawat  baru dalam rangka ekspansi  rute yang sudah dimiliki saat ini. <br/><br/>\"Dalam  rencana bisnis perusahaan Merpati 20 unit pesawat  berkapasitas 20  tempat duduk. PTDI kami lihat mampu memenuhi permintaan  kami pada  2014-2015,\" ujarnya. <br/><br/>Menurutnya, harga satu unit N-219 berkisar  US$4 juta sehingga  butuh dana sekitar US$80 juta untuk 20 unit.  \"Dananya tentu akan kami  cari. Ini di luar dari PMN yang kami terima  nanti sebesar Rp516 miliar  itu,\" ujar Sardjono. <br/><br/>Sebelumnya  Merpati menghadapi tudingan negatif mengenai  pembelian pesawat MA-60  dari China. Pembelian itu menjadi perpincangan  setelah pesawat produksi  Negeri Tirai Bambu itu jatuh dan menewaskan  seluruh penumpang. <br/><br/>Terkait  pesangan Merpati itu, Head of Structure Design PT  Dirgantara Indonesia  Budi Sampurno mengatakan pesawat N-219 diperkirakan  akan mengudara  secepatnya pada 2014. <br/><br/>PT DI menyebut akan segera menyelesaikan  produksi pesawat  tersebut dan segera akan menjalani proses sertifikasi  pada 2013. Budi  menambahkan untuk penjualan tahun pertama di 2014  pesawat baru ini akan  dipasarkan di dalam negeri. \"Untuk tahun 2014,  targetnya lokal dulu.  Untuk sipil sebanyak 97 pesawat, untuk militer 57  pesawat,\" ujar Budi.</p><p><br/></p> <p>(Media Indonesia)</p><div style=\"font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;\"><div

        "cleaned_post_text": "Menteri BUMN Mustafa Abubakar mendorong PT Merpati Nusantara  Airlines  (Merpati) bekerja sama untuk penggunaan pesawat N-219 produksi  PT  Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI).\"Walau masih terlalu dini  namun kerja sama antara Merpati dan PT  DI akan merupakan sinergi saling  menguntungkan. Mereka akan segera  menandatangani kontrak kerja  produksi 20 unit N-219 oleh PT DI untuk  memenuhi kebutuhan Merpati,\"  kata Menteri BUMN Mustafa Abubakar, seusai  Rapat Kerja dengan Komisi VI  DPR, di Gedung MPR/DPR, Jakarta, Senin  (4/7).Menurut Mustafa,  sinergi merupakan salah satu langkah yang harus  ditempuh sehingga  restrukturisasi yang sedang dilakukan terhadap kedua  perusahaan  tersebut mencapai hasil lebih maksimal.Pada kesempatan itu  pemerintah bersama dengan Komisi VI DPR  menyetujui suntikan dana dalam  bentuk Penyertaan Modal Negara (PMN)  kepada Merpati sebesar Rp516  miliar, sedangkan PTDI diusulkan  mendapatkan PMN sekitar Rp2 triiun  dari APBN 2012.Direktur Utama Merpati Sardjono Jhony  Tjitrokusumo mengakui  pihaknya membutuhkan sebanyak 20 unit pesawat  baru dalam rangka ekspansi  rute yang sudah dimiliki saat ini.\"Dalam  rencana bisnis perusahaan Merpati 20 unit pesawat  berkapasitas 20  tempat duduk. PTDI kami lihat mampu memenuhi permintaan  kami pada  2014-2015,\" ujarnya.Menurutnya, harga satu unit N-219 berkisar  US$4 juta sehingga  butuh dana sekitar US$80 juta untuk 20 unit.  \"Dananya tentu akan kami  cari. Ini di luar dari PMN yang kami terima  nanti sebesar Rp516 miliar  itu,\" ujar Sardjono.Sebelumnya  Merpati menghadapi tudingan negatif mengenai  pembelian pesawat MA-60  dari China. Pembelian itu menjadi perpincangan  setelah pesawat produksi  Negeri Tirai Bambu itu jatuh dan menewaskan  seluruh penumpang.Terkait  pesangan Merpati itu, Head of Structure Design PT  Dirgantara Indonesia  Budi Sampurno mengatakan pesawat N-219 diperkirakan  akan mengudara  secepatnya pada 2014.PT DI menyebut akan segera menyelesaikan  produksi pesawat  tersebut dan segera akan menjalani proses sertifikasi  pada 2013. Budi  menambahkan untuk penjualan tahun pertama di 2014  pesawat baru ini akan  dipasarkan di dalam negeri. \"Untuk tahun 2014,  targetnya lokal dulu.  Untuk sipil sebanyak 97 pesawat, untuk militer 57  pesawat,\" ujar Budi.(Media Indonesia)Support by :",

Yakni PT Kereta Api dan PT Angkasa Pura II. Penunjukan langsung ini  didasarkan kepada peraturan presiden (Perpres).<br/><br/>Direktur Jenderal  Perkeretaapian Kementerian Perhubungan (Kemenhub) Tundjung Inderawan  mengatakan, kedua BUMN nantinya akan membangun rel KA mulai dari Stasiun  Duri, Jakarta Barat menuju Bandara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta,  Cengkareng, Banten sepanjang 7 kilometer. Sedangkan dari Stasiun Duri  menuju Manggarai, menggunakan rel yang ada.<br/><br/>\"Proyek itu akan kami  serahkan setelah terbitnya Perpres. Karena hanya dengan dasar ini,  penunjukan langsung bisa dilakukan atau sifatnya mendesak,\" katanya  Selasa (28/6), saat meninjau lokasi proyek KA Bandara bersama anggota  Komisi V DPR.<br/><br/>Dia mengaku optimis, kebijakan penunjukan langsung  akan mempercepat pelaksanaan proyek. Selain berpengalaman, kedua bUMN  juga memiliki anggaran untuk membangun jaringan kereta. Jaringan KA  Bandara akan menggunakan jalur ganda, sehingga percepatan arus pelayanan  bisa dioptimalkan dan semua ruas yang dilewati akan disterilkan.<br/><br/>\"Semua  ruas rel akan kami amankan dengan pagar beton. Rumah-rumah kumuh yang  sekarang ini ada di sekitar jalan akan kembali kami bersihkan,\" tutur  Tundjung.<br/><br/>Pembangunan rel sepanjang 7 kilometer memakan dana Rp  280 miliar untuk setiap ruas. \"Karena jalur ganda, jadi dikali dua saja.  Ini luar biaya untuk pembangunan stasiun dan gerbong kereta,\" kata dia.<br/><br/>Menurut  Tundjung, proyek KA Bandara ini diperkirakan bisa dimulai pada tahun  depan. Dengan target pembangunan selama 2 tahun, maka KA Bandaraa dapat  dioperasikan pada akhir 2013. Pada 2010, lalu Ditjen Perkeretaapian  Kemenhub menganggarkan dana Rp 18,6 miliar untuk pembangunan KA Bandara.<br/><br/>Sedangkan  pada 2011, anggaran yang disiapkan sebesar Rp 28,2 miliar. Bahkan untuk  2012 dan 2013, pemerintah juga akan menganggarkan dana untuk KA  Bandara.</font></p><font size=\"3\"> </font><p><font size=\"3\"><br/></font></p><p><font size=\"3\">(Suara Karya

Jaringan KA  Bandara akan menggunakan jalur ganda, sehingga percepatan arus pelayanan  bisa dioptimalkan dan semua ruas yang dilewati akan disterilkan.\"Semua  ruas rel akan kami amankan dengan pagar beton. Rumah-rumah kumuh yang  sekarang ini ada di sekitar jalan akan kembali kami bersihkan,\" tutur  Tundjung.Pembangunan rel sepanjang 7 kilometer memakan dana Rp  280 miliar untuk setiap ruas. \"Karena jalur ganda, jadi dikali dua saja.  Ini luar biaya untuk pembangunan stasiun dan gerbong kereta,\" kata dia.Menurut  Tundjung, proyek KA Bandara ini diperkirakan bisa dimulai pada tahun  depan. Dengan target pembangunan selama 2 tahun, maka KA Bandaraa dapat  dioperasikan pada akhir 2013. Pada 2010, lalu Ditjen Perkeretaapian  Kemenhub menganggarkan dana Rp 18,6 miliar untuk pembangunan KA Bandara.Sedangkan  pada 2011, anggaran yang disiapkan sebesar Rp 28,2 miliar. Bahkan untuk  2012 dan 2013, pemerintah juga akan menganggarkan dana untuk KA  Bandara.(Suara Karya Online)Support by :",
