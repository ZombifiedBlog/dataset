It's not the first time Amazon has sued authors and services for manipulating Amazon's ratings system. In 2015, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8376813/amazon-sues-fake-review-websites\" target=\"_blank\">sued several websites</a> that offered bogus reviews for a fee. By 2016, the number of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/amazon-sues-more-sellers-for-buying-fake-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">fake reviewers sued</a> by Amazon had risen to over a thousand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that gaming Amazon's system is the norm. I've even experienced the work of Amazon gamers. One \"reviewer\" left a negative review on one of my books, only to recommend another book they said was better. (I became suspicious because the recommended book was on an entirely different subject.) After some research I discovered that these reviews had appeared verbatim on other books in the same category as mine. It was obvious that the \"reviewer\" was paid.

The new system is based on number of pages read, rather than downloads, because paid services were downloading books in order to boost a book's ranking.

Thu-Huong Ha, writing for Quartz, has described <a href=\"https://qz.com/1077996/self-publishing-on-amazon-amzn-how-an-author-can-hack-a-books-success-sales-and-royalties/\" target=\"_blank\">in vivid detail</a> some of the tricks being employed.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Inflating pages read. How can Amazon determine the number of pages a person has read of an ebook? Simple. Reading devices do not record the pages you read sequentially. Therefore, if someone is on the first page, and then jumps to the last page, the device will record the whole book as read. Who would want to read only two pages? Well, nobody. But if on the first page there is a \"free offer\" of something on the last page - voila! These books can even be composed of complete nonsense, and there will still be a payout.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Authors can create fake accounts, or hire a service that owns numerous accounts, to download massive numbers of books on free days. The author earns nothing, but the book will appear on Amazon's bestseller list for free books, which will enhance its attractiveness to future buyers.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Fake reviews. This has been a problem from the start. An author or company can buy fake reviews on Fiverr for a few bucks. Authors and companies can also purchase negative reviews of similar products (that's what happened to me) in order to drive down the ratings of the competition. Amazon has become so paranoid about fake reviews that it will remove a review from anyone even vaguely connected to the author - a Facebook friend, for example, whom the author may never have met.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line on Amazon rankings is that the system will always be gamed. It doesn't matter how many people Amazon sues, or how many new contortions it introduces into KDP, there will always be some way to work around it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes you long for the old days, when all you had to do to get bestseller status was either sleep with a reviewer for the New York Times, or give birth to one.

In this latest wrinkle, German publishers have launched an antitrust complaint against Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile German publishers are joining forces in this antitrust move, let us remember that the largest publishing company <i><b>in the world</b></i>, Random/Penguin, is owned by Bertelsmann, a privately owned German company which also happens to control a major chunk of the world’s media outlets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of Bertelsmann's corporate divisions, RTL, is Europe’s largest broadcasting and production company. With programming rights in 150 countries, it is currently the largest independent TV distribution company outside the United States. Another of its divisions, Gruner + Jahr, is the largest publisher of newspapers and magazines in Europe, with more than 285 print titles in over 20 countries.

The retailer has a fast growing grocery business and both Stone and Esposito pointed to Amazon plans to launch its own TV set box.
