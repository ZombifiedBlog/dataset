Sanayi Mahallesi means “industrial neighborhood” in Turkish, a name whose accuracy makes up for what it might lack in creativity. The district is home to a somewhat grungy assortment of garages and warehouses, with the occasional office park that’s crept in from the neighboring financial district in search of lower rents.</p>\n<p>I follow a zig-zagging street downhill—one is always either walking uphill or downhill in Istanbul—past the Kağıthane State Hospital, before spotting a triangle-shaped logo in front of an otherwise unmarked storefront. I ring the bell and am soon greeted by one of the best coffee brewers in the world, Aslı Yaman, who welcomes me into <a href=\"http://kimmacoffee.com/\">Kimma Coffee Roasters’</a> new roastery and training lab.</p>\n<p>Aslı Yaman is tall with cropped hair. She speaks English—and Turkish—in a distinctive soprano with a certain musical quality. She’s upbeat and cheerful, despite being tired from a busy few days in Madrid—her first board meeting as a trustee of the <a href=\"https://sca.coffee/\">Specialty Coffee Association</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_140018\" style=\"width: 1180px\"><img alt=\"kimma coffee roasters instanbul turkey\" class=\"size-large wp-image-140018\" height=\"780\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\" src=\"https://sprudge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kimma-Coffee-Roasters-yaman-2-1170x780.jpg\" srcset=\"http://331mrnu3ylm2k3db3s1xd1hg.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kimma-Coffee-Roasters-yaman-2-1170x780.jpg 1170w, http://331mrnu3ylm2k3db3s1xd1hg.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kimma-Coffee-Roasters-yaman-2-770x513.jpg 770w, http://331mrnu3ylm2k3db3s1xd1hg.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kimma-Coffee-Roasters-yaman-2-768x512.jpg 768w, http://331mrnu3ylm2k3db3s1xd1hg.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kimma-Coffee-Roasters-yaman-2-830x553.jpg 830w\" width=\"1170\"/>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aslı Yaman</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ushering me into Kimma’s training lab, Yaman offers to brew me a coffee, recommending a natural process Costa Rica.

In addition to being home to their coffee roasting operations, Kimma’s headquarters hosts a steady stream of courses in the Specialty Coffee Association’s Coffee Skills program.
