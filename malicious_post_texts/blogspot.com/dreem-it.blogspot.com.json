I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1270 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Transfer $1330 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 12aJgkbT9o zAZnVwiKDg76 FNpS6FcCeVvS  Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.   An important notice: I have specified my Bitcoin wallet with spaces, hence once you carry out a transfer,   please make sure that you key-in my bitcoin address without spaces to be sure that your funds successfully reach my wallet!   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!</span></font></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

All you need to do is pay.# In case if you decide to find me - that is a bad idea, since I am using nodes, same as blockchain system, which are used to carry out bitcoin transactions.# The idea to reinstall the Operating System would not help either. Even if you burn down your device, it still won't solve the problem.All the files have already been encrypted and saved at remote file hosting websites.# Once the transaction is complete, there is no need to notify me about that. I will be able to see it by myself, since I am monitoring all your online activities.Please keep in mind the most important thing:Once you complete the transaction, I will delete my Trojan virus from your device as well as all the discrediting videos from remote online resources.Afterwards, you can forget about me and this unpleasant situation as well. That is the best solution to this problem!One last advice for you: change all the access information to all your online services, since I may be not only one who has the access to all your accounts!Please be reasonable.Good luck!",

In addition, we provide guidance below on what you can do to protect your personal information.<br/>   <br/> <strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>  On February 11, 2019, ShareThis became aware that it suffered a data security incident when it was informed that <em>The Register </em>published a story indicating that 16 companies, including ShareThis, were the victims of a data theft. We can tell from our initial investigations that email addresses, hashed passwords and some birth dates were impacted.  The incident, unfortunately, only came to light when <em>The Register</em> reported that the hacker posted the data for sale on the dark web.<br/>   <br/> <strong>What Information Was Involved?</strong><br/>  Although our investigation is ongoing, we believe that the incident occurred in July 2018 and your name, email and hashed password may have been acquired by an unauthorized person or persons. Please note that we have no indication that your password has been used by the hacker or other unauthorized individual. As a result, your personal data may have been compromised.  <br/>   <br/> <strong>What We Are Doing.</strong><br/>  We value your privacy and deeply regret that this incident occurred.  ShareThis will be deactivating any ShareThis accounts associated with this email address.  We are reviewing our internal systems and are in the process of working with forensic and data security experts to review this incident and to identify any additional measures we can take to further bolster our security.   <br/>   <br/> <strong>What You Can Do.</strong><br/>  We want to make sure that you have resources to protect your personal information.  As noted above, we deactivated the ShareThis account associated with this email address, so no one will be able to log into it.  However, we recommend that you change your password for any other accounts for which you use the same or similar email address or password and take other appropriate steps to protect your online accounts.  We also encourage you to be cautious of spam or other phishing emails, including those that solicit personal data.
