I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that. \r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1\r<br/> <br/>You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.\r<br/>Following that, the video will be posted on the web!\r<br/> <br/>Remember!

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hey!As you can see, this is not a formal email, and unfortunately, it does not mean anything good for you.BUT do not despair, it is not critical. I am going to explain to you everything right now.I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use.I have been tracking your activity for the last few months.How did that happen?You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it.The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network.It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now,I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing.
