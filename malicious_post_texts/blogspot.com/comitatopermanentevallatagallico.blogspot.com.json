Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 15KquhG7RGkyXvEVT1aXLgPt4qgBEVe8rNYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it.The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network.It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now,I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that.My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.Following that, the video will be posted on the web!Remember! Time tracking will start as soon as you open this email, I am monitoring this!Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",
