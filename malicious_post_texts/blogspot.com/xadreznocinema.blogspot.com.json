The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).   Here is my Bitcoin address: 18bSTrufLfuvHwS7JYuF626MBGULSmxTgR    I really want to settle this situation in a peaceful manner and I believe you want that too.    Nothing personal, it is simply my job.   Make sure you use valid Antivirus software and stay away from unwanted websites.  Take care of yourself.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 12nEVuGNtRFMVjeVmLtD4nt2sHX68S47yH   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Yeah, you are one of them. Not everyone chooses to watch such hardcore videos...\r<br/>Basically, I have infected your device with one of the best Trojan viruses in the market. It was relatively easy, since I have access to your email address (<a href=\"mailto:marcosnatal.cinema@blogger.com\">marcosnatal.cinema@blogger.com</a>).\r<br/>It was sufficient to prepare one of your routine emails asking you to click the harmful link...\r<br/> <br/>My spyware functions as a driver. Hence, I can fully control your device and have access to your microphone, camera, cursor and set of symbols.\r<br/>Generally speaking, your device is some sort of my remote PC.\r<br/>Since this spyware is driver-based, then I can constantly update its signatures, so that no antivirus can detect it.\r<br/>While digging through your hard drive, I have saved your entire contact list, social media access, chat history and media files.\r<br/> <br/>One week ago, I have montaged a videoclip, which shows you masturbating on one side of the screen and on the other side a porn video \r<br/>that you were watching at that moment of time - recently this type of exotic stuff is really popular on the internet!\r<br/>Don't worry, I will need just a few mouse clicks in order to share this video with your entire contact list and upload it to some porn website, like Bigle.\r<br/>I believe that you would not like this to happen, since a long holiday season is just about to start soon - \r<br/>just imagine the number of silly jokes and loud laughter that would get provoked by your video all over the neighbourhood bars and pubs...\r<br/> <br/>I am offering a simple and reasonable solution:\r<br/>All you need to do is transfer an amount equivalent to $1450 (USA Dollars) to my bitcoin wallet and we both forget about this silly story forever.\r<br/>All your data and this video will be deleted by me once and for all. You have my honest word!\r<br/>You've got to agree, this amount is really insignificant. Just imagine how much time and resources I have spent to get this done... \r<br/>If you don't know how to operate the cryptocurrency - you can always search for assistance online. It is that simple.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1LsTK4bKaUGMXgbqo4n3Vc7quu6UvATjfz\r<br/> <br/>You have exactly 2 days (48 hours) from the moment of opening this email. \r<br/>I can easily track when you have opened this email (my software will notify me about it).

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have got two not really pleasant news for you.I have been monitoring your internet activities for some time by now.The only person to blame in this situation is you, since you are a big fan of adult websites and also have got an uncontrollable desire to indulge yourself with another orgasm.Simply speaking, all your porn websites search requests have become a key to access your device.The thing is that I word in a company that provides services related to security and performance of email providers, includingblogger.comas well.During the pandemic outbreak a lot of providers have faced difficulties in maintaining a huge number of staff in their offices and so they have decided to use outsourcing instead.While working remotely from home, I have got unlimited abilities to access the user databases.I can easily decrypt passwords of users, access their chat history and online traffic with help of cookie-files.I have decided to analyse users traffic related to adult websites and adult content.I was truly shocked to discover that nearly 75% of users regularly access porn websites or participates in sex chats.I have filtered out the worst perverts from the list. Yeah, you are one of them. Not everyone chooses to watch such hardcore videos...Basically, I have infected your device with one of the best Trojan viruses in the market. It was relatively easy, since I have access to your email address (marcosnatal.cinema@blogger.com).It was sufficient to prepare one of your routine emails asking you to click the harmful link...My spyware functions as a driver. Hence, I can fully control your device and have access to your microphone, camera, cursor and set of symbols.Generally speaking, your device is some sort of my remote PC.Since this spyware is driver-based, then I can constantly update its signatures, so that no antivirus can detect it.While digging through your hard drive, I have saved your entire contact list, social media access, chat history and media files.One week ago, I have montaged a videoclip, which shows you masturbating on one side of the screen and on the other side a porn videothat you were watching at that moment of time - recently this type of exotic stuff is really popular on the internet!Don't worry, I will need just a few mouse clicks in order to share this video with your entire contact list and upload it to some porn website, like Bigle.I believe that you would not like this to happen, since a long holiday season is just about to start soon -just imagine the number of silly jokes and loud laughter that would get provoked by your video all over the neighbourhood bars and pubs...I am offering a simple and reasonable solution:All you need to do is transfer an amount equivalent to $1450 (USA Dollars) to my bitcoin wallet and we both forget about this silly story forever.All your data and this video will be deleted by me once and for all. You have my honest word!You've got to agree, this amount is really insignificant. Just imagine how much time and resources I have spent to get this done...If you don't know how to operate the cryptocurrency - you can always search for assistance online. It is that simple.Here is my bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1LsTK4bKaUGMXgbqo4n3Vc7quu6UvATjfzYou have exactly 2 days (48 hours) from the moment of opening this email.I can easily track when you have opened this email (my software will notify me about it). Once you complete the transaction - I will be able to see and confirm that.Please, do not try replying me via this email - there is no point in that (I have generated the header of this email as well as return address).Remember that there is no point to complain anywhere, since I cannot be found (Bitcoin system is anonymous and I am also using I2P network in order to access your device).I have considered all the small details.In case, if 48 hours after you have opened this email,I still don't receive the required amount of money, then your videoclip will be automatically sent to all your contact list and uploaded to public websites.Good luck and please don't hate me too much!This is life! You are merely out of luck this time.Who knows, maybe next time you will get lucky at something else...",
