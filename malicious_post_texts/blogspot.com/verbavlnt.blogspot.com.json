        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi!Sadly, there are some bad news that you are about to hear.About few months ago I have gained a full access to all devices used by you for internet browsing.Shortly after, I started recording all internet activities done by you.Below is the sequence of events of how that happened:Earlier I purchased from hackers a unique access to diversified email accounts (at the moment, it is really easy to do using internet).As you can see, I managed to log in to your email account without breaking a sweat: (lucio_fdp1.claudia@blogger.com).Within one week afterwards, I installed a Trojan virus in your Operating Systems available on all devices that you utilize for logging in your email.To be frank, it was somewhat a very easy task (since you were kind enough to open some of links provided in your inbox emails).I know, you may be thinking now that I'm a genius.With help of that useful software, I am now able to gain access to all the controllers located in your devices (e.g., video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, managed to download all your photos, personal data, history of web browsing and other info to my servers without any problems.Moreover, I now have access to all accounts in your messengers, social networks, emails, contacts list, chat history - you name it.My Trojan virus continues refreshing its signatures in a non-stop manner (because it is operated by driver),hence it remains undetected by any antivirus software installed in your PC or device.So, I guess now you finally understand the reason why I could never be caught until this very letter...During the process of your personal info compilation, I could not help but notice that you are a huge admirer and regular guest of websites with adult content.You endure a lot of pleasure while checking out porn websites, watching nasty porn movies and reaching breathtaking orgasms.Let me be frank with you, it was really hard to resist from recording some of those naughty solo scenes with you in main role and compiling them in special videosthat expose your masturbation sessions, which end with you cumming.In case if you still have doubts, all I need is to click my mouse and all those nasty videos with you will be shared to friends, colleagues, and relatives of yours.Moreover, nothing stops me from uploading all that hot content online, so all public can watch it too.I sincerely hope, you would really not prefer that to happen, keeping in mind all the dirty things you like to watch,(you certainly know what I mean) it will completely ruin your reputation.However, don't worry, there is still a way to resolve this:You need to carry out a $1290 USD transfer to my wallet (equivalent amount in bitcoins depending on exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transaction, I will proceed with deleting all the filthy videos with you in main role.Afterwards, we can forget about this unpleasant accident. Furthermore, I guarantee that all the malicious software will also be erased from your devices and accounts.Mark my words, I never lie.That is a great bargain with a low price, I assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recordingand tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.In case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.Here is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 1LrBGezKti4m2cov7CKuurLnCfQvjp2o1AFrom now on, you have only 48 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, 2 days).The following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:> Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).> Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services. In addition, it's a bad idea if you want to share it with your friends,hoping they would help. If I happen to find out (knowing my awesome skills, it can be done effortlessly,because I have all your devices and accounts under my control and unceasing observation) - kinky videos of yours will be share to public the same day.> Abstain from trying to look for me - that would not lead anywhere either. Cryptocurrency transactions are absolutely anonymous and cannot be tracked.> Abstain from reinstalling your OS on devices or throwing them away.

(0_o)!My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.As I was gathering information about you, I couldn't help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.I can also make those vids become accessible by public.I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1340 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process - it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: 1JfnsTBvRQYNvzxYFTQBtEUgojmPy2vd6FYou should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) - your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.#Do not try searching for me - there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.The following list contains things you should not be worried about:#That your money won't reach my account.- Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.- Trust me, it's pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!Let's make this deal in a fair manner!Owh, one more thing...in future it is best that you don't involve yourself in similar situations any longer!One last advice from me - recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.",

I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that. \r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1\r<br/> <br/>You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.\r<br/>Following that, the video will be posted on the web!\r<br/> <br/>Remember!
