I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

You have nothing to worry about,\r<br/>because I keep my word at all times.\r<br/> <br/>That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\r<br/>taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\r<br/>If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C\r<br/> <br/>All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\r<br/>&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\r<br/>&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\r<br/> If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - \r<br/> your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away. \r<br/>&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (rodneydnelson.nederlanden@blogger.com).Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).Yeah, geniuses are among us.Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9CAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.

Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.
