Just late last year, <a href=\"http://tiredmama-ph.blogspot.com/2017/11/goosegrassparagis-10-potential-health.html\" target=\"_blank\">Indian goosegrass </a>became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. </div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.</div>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NU_QKset4QQ/WwXtyIa9OgI/AAAAAAAADmg/xzLGtONbw1UQ22U3M9tW1Hg2uH3pEu3ngCLcBGAs/s1600/Sabah%2BSnake%2Bgrass%2Bplant.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"599\" data-original-width=\"490\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NU_QKset4QQ/WwXtyIa9OgI/AAAAAAAADmg/xzLGtONbw1UQ22U3M9tW1Hg2uH3pEu3ngCLcBGAs/s1600/Sabah%2BSnake%2Bgrass%2Bplant.JPG\"/></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style='background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: \"arial\" , \"helvetica\" , sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;'><b>English:</b> Clinacanthus nutans by <a href=\"https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clinacanthus_nutans_03.JPG\">Vinayaraj</a> (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under <a href=\"ttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a></span></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h4>\nClinacanthus nutans</h4>\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, <a href=\"http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2727901\"><i>Clinacanthus nutans </i>(Burm. F.)<i> </i>Lindau</a>, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, <i>belalai gajah</i> in Malay, <i>phaya yo/</i> <i class=\"\">phaya</i> <i class=\"\">plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw</i> in Thai,<i> e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao</i> in China, and <i>dandang gendis</i> or <i>ki tajam</i> in Indonesia.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flowers of the <i>Clinacanthus nutans </i>are arranged in a <b>cyme</b> which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.<br/>\n<span style=\"color: #444444; font-size: x-small;\">*Click here for the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13880209.2017.1288749\">image of leaves, stem, and flower</a>.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VUegI2JVVv4/WwXqRS2u8-I/AAAAAAAADmM/by0Ek1HeNLgdt3fbE3r00SEsL9R8ixzCACLcBGAs/s1600/Sabah%2Bsnake%2Bgrass%2Bfloweer.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"470\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VUegI2JVVv4/WwXqRS2u8-I/AAAAAAAADmM/by0Ek1HeNLgdt3fbE3r00SEsL9R8ixzCACLcBGAs/s1600/Sabah%2Bsnake%2Bgrass%2Bfloweer.JPG\"/></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style='color: #444444; font-family: \"arial\" , \"helvetica\" , sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;'><b>English:</b> Clinacanthus nutans by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clinacanthus_nutans_06.JPG\">Vinayaraj</a> (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under <a href=\"ttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a></span></span></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4>\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass</h4>\n<h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Sabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities.

They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the <i>Clinacanthus nutans.</i> Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested.

Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for </span>high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><i>Clinacanthus nutans</i> tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2.</span> Anti-inflammatory<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the study, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18207341\">The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts</a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats.

The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of <i>C. siamensis</i> (a synonym of <i>C. nutans)</i> leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that <i>C. siamensis</i> had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo.

Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the study, </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2221169115309643\">Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from <i>Clinacanthus nutans</i>, a traditional Thai herbal medicine</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">monogalactosy</span>l<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> diglyceride (MGDG) and </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">digalactosyl diglyceride</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). </span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, the authors found that: </span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from<i> C. nutans</i> demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; </span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The authors postulated that </span>monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of <i>C. nutans </i>have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sangkitporn et al.

Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with <i>Clinacanthus nutans </i>(BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the <i>C. </i><i>nutan</i>s extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the<i> C. nutans</i> extracts treatment group.

As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One focus is the </span>antiproliferative ability<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">While antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, </span>antitumorigenic compounds <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, <i>Clinacanthus nutans</i> (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">activity </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of <i>C. nutans.</i> In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the <i>C. nutans </i>treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces </span>apoptosis<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One notable study, </span><i><a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/462751/\">Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines</a> </i><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">(Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">a.)<i> C. nutans</i> in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">b.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">c.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (&lt;20 μg/ml) suggesting that <i>C. nutans </i>chloroform extract is</span> not a strong anticancer regimen<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">d.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of <i>C. nutans</i> as an </span>alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13880209.2016.1242145\">Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts</a> (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.</span> Antivenom</div>\n</h4>\n<h4>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><i>Clinacanthus nutans</i></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Burm. f.) and <i>Naja naja siamensis </i>venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of <i>C. nutans</i> can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified <i>N.n siamensis</i> neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, </span>it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after <i>Heterometrus laoticus</i> venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including <i>C. nutans </i>stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. </span>Anti-microbial<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Due to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">I have chanced upon a study that included <i>C. nutans</i> in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on <i>C.nutans</i> solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that<i> Clinacanthus nutans</i> possess significant antibacterial effect against <i>S.aureus and E.coli</i> due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for <i>B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium</i> demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8.</span> As treatment for canker sores<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of</span><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> C. nutans</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">orabase </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for recurrent </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">apthous </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that </span><i style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. nutans</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">orabase was</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">orabase.

It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.</span> Immunomodulatory Activity<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the study, </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281614653_Clinacanthus_nutans_Burmf_Lindau_Ethanol_Extract_Inhibits_Hepatoma_in_Mice_through_Upregulation_of_the_Immune_Response\">Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that <i>C. nutans</i> has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of <i>C. nutans</i> displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. </span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this<span class=\"\" style='font-family: \"times\" , \"times new roman\" , serif;'>,</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span style='font-family: \"times\" , \"times new roman\" , serif;'> </span></span>the effects of the extract of the leaves of <i>C. </i></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><i>nutans</i> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interleukin-4</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of <i>C. nutans </i>and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. </span>(<a href=\"http://budgetitc.dmsc.moph.go.th/research/pdf/199635.pdf\">Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon\"> interferon</a>, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span>\n<br/>\n<h3>\nSabah snake grass today</h3>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: <span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)</span></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/></span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Print Article⎙Recently, medicinal herbs and plants have been gaining rapid global attention for their therapeutic potential. Just late last year,Indian goosegrassbecame a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his.Medicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.Sabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.English:Clinacanthus nutans byVinayaraj(via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed underCC BY-SA 3.0Sabah Snake Grass Botany and General InformationClinacanthus nutansSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name,Clinacanthus nutans(Burm. F.)Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites,belalai gajahin Malay,phaya yo/phayaplongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yawin Thai,e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun caoin China, anddandang gendisorki tajamin Indonesia.Sabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.The flowers of theClinacanthus nutansare arranged in acymewhich in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.*Click here for theimage of leaves, stem, and flower.English:Clinacanthus nutans byVinayaraj(via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed underCC BY-SA 3.0Phytochemistry of Sabah snake grassSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:Vitexin(Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)-C-glycosyl flavoneIsovitexin(Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)-C-glycosyl flavoneOrientin(Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)-C-glycosyl flavoneIsoorientin(Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)-C-glycosyl flavoneShaftoside(Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)-C-glycosyl flavoneClinacoside A(Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycosideClinacoside B(Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycosideClinamide A(Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compoundClinamide B(Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compoundClinamide C(Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a(Sakdarat et al. 2009)(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol(Dampawan et al. 1977)Beta-sitoserol(Dampawan et al. 1977)Isomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside(Chelyn et al. 2014)-C-glycosyl flavone2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A(Tu et al. 2014)Shaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside)(Huang et al. 2015)-flavonoidApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside(Huang et al. 2015)Gendarucin A(Khoo et al. 2015)3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid(Khoo et al. 2015)ascorbic acid(Khoo et al. 2015)oxoprolinates(Khoo et al. 2015)cerebrosides(Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)Entadamide A(Tu et al. 2014)EntadamideC(Tu et al. 2014)2-cis-entadamide A(Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compoundtrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol(Tu et al. 2014)(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol(Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)trigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides(Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003)- compounds which are anti-HSV effective13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b(Sakdarat et al. 2006)132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b(Sakdarat et al. 2006)132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a(Sakdarat et al. 2006)132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a(Sakdarat et al. 2006)*Click here for thechemical structures of the compoundsfound in Sabah snake grass.The overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant.Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, andmonoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes ofClinacanthusnutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.In 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of theClinacanthus nutans.Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, foroptimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.The oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study ofClinacanthus nutans(Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).Acanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans byVanLap Hoangis licensed underCC BY 2.0Health Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass1.Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals.Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective forhigh blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.Clinacanthus nutanstea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.2.Anti-inflammatorySabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.In the study,The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts,it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)Another study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.),Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities ofClinacanthus nutansAerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds.Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamideA were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.Another notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.3.Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza AvtivityIn relation to their study of bioactive compounds ofC. nutansaerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showedmoderate anti-dengue virus activitywith an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.Influenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity ofC. siamensis(a synonym ofC. nutans)leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported thatC. siamensishad an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short,it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection4.Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activityTraditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.In the study,Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride fromClinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purifiedmonogalactosyldiglyceride (MGDG) anddigalactosyl diglyceride(DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells).Here, the authors found that:a.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;b.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG fromC. nutansdemonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples;c.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;d.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.The authors postulated thatmonogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglycerideare one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies ofC. nutanshave reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation ofClinacanthus nutanson 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster withClinacanthus nutans(BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in theC.nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in theC. nutansextracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.Creams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.English:Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass byMokkie(via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced underCC BY-SA 4.05.Anti-cancerThe anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.One focus is theantiproliferative abilityof compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).While antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction,antitumorigenic compoundsprevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study,Clinacanthus nutans(Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenicactivityofC. nutans.In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in theC. nutanstreated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass inducesapoptosis(programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.One notable study,Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines(Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:a.)C. nutansin chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.b.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.c.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting thatC. nutanschloroform extract isnot a strong anticancer regimen.d.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential ofC. nutansas analternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.Although most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts(Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.6.AntivenomTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts ofClinacanthus nutans(Burm. f.) andNaja naja siamensisvenom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract ofC. nutanscan not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purifiedN.n siamensisneurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus,it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.Consequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis afterHeterometrus laoticusvenom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants includingC. nutansstating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.7.Anti-microbialDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.I have chanced upon a study that includedC. nutansin its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies onC.nutanssolely for its anti-microbial activity, reported thatClinacanthus nutanspossess significant antibacterial effect againstS.aureus and E.colidue to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml forB. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhiumdemonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).8.As treatment for canker soresA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy ofC. nutansinorabasefor recurrentapthousstomatitis (canker cores) and it was found thatC. nutansinorabase wasmore effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide inorabase. Apthousstomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.9.Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grassAs its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.In China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.10.Immunomodulatory ActivityIn the study,Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response(Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest thatC. nutanshas potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract ofC. nutansdisplaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions.In addition to this,the effects of the extract of the leaves ofC.nutanson modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml.Interleukin-4has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract ofC. nutansand may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections.(Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenousinterferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.Sabah snake grass todayDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage:(cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)Stage 1 CA: 30 leaves per dayStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per dayStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per dayStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per dayThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.Method 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)Wash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day.Method 2: As juice.Directions for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:a) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.*Singapore Sabah Snake GrassYou may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple.For maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves dailyHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.It has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some,C. nutanspartnered withStobilanthes crispusis a more potent remedy or another herb known asElephantes scaber(dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.Please note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.*Click on this study and look forTable 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.Please note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.There is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Although some domain registrar sites allow their clients to renew their domains using their PayPal balance, most usually ask that new domains be registered using a credit card. Not wanting to tap into the household's finances, I searched for sites that allow you to purchase using your PayPal balance and I, fortunately, found Namecheap.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nAlthough Namecheap wasn't offering the usually coveted dot-com domains for $0.99 like GoDaddy, I found that it was offering other TLD's for $0.88 with a free subscription of WhoisGuard for a year. Unfortunately, GoDaddy asks more for privacy protection so I opted for Namecheap with a dot site TLD and with the additional ICANN fees, I paid $1.17 for a one-year subscription. I clicked on PayPal as my payment option (you have to scroll down to find it), and voila! I finally purchased my first custom domain and was immediately redirected to my domain's dashboard which asked for email verification.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIt takes about 10-15 minutes for your custom domain to become active. So, while I was waiting for the yellow alert status of my domain to turn to the green active status, I did my research on how to switch from subdomain to custom domain. I started with Namecheap's instructions which in my opinion wasn't very clear. I then headed to Blogger and Google's Support Forum which again wasn't too clear for a tech idiot like myself. To be honest, Blogger confused me even more. I tried to Google how and went through almost all blogs that discussed how to make the switch. So, putting 2 and 2 together and collectively interlocking all the information from all the sites, I finally was able to actively register my site and create a CNAME record. It took me 3 whole hours. I'm such a dork.</div>\n<br/>\n<h3>\nHow to Change Blogspot Subdomain to Custom Domain from Namecheap</h3>\n<br/>\n1. After purchasing a custom domain from Namecheap and being redirected to dashboard, verify your new custom domain via email address and wait for 10-15 minutes for active status.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Open a new window and head to your Blogger Blogspot Dashboard, look for \"Settings\", click on \" Basic\".<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Look for Blog Address which will show your Blogspot URL.

There were 2 entries under host records after I clicked on \"Advanced DNS\". One was a CNAME pointing to Namecheap and another with the name of my custom domain that had the word \"unmask\". I didn't know if I should delete it or not. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure that one out. It would have been nice if the instructions provided by Namecheap just said delete everything there and proceed with the CNAME records given by Blogger. Just so people like me wouldn't be confused.

Not wanting to tap into the household's finances, I searched for sites that allow you to purchase using your PayPal balance and I, fortunately, found Namecheap.Although Namecheap wasn't offering the usually coveted dot-com domains for $0.99 like GoDaddy, I found that it was offering other TLD's for $0.88 with a free subscription of WhoisGuard for a year. Unfortunately, GoDaddy asks more for privacy protection so I opted for Namecheap with a dot site TLD and with the additional ICANN fees, I paid $1.17 for a one-year subscription. I clicked on PayPal as my payment option (you have to scroll down to find it), and voila! I finally purchased my first custom domain and was immediately redirected to my domain's dashboard which asked for email verification.It takes about 10-15 minutes for your custom domain to become active. So, while I was waiting for the yellow alert status of my domain to turn to the green active status, I did my research on how to switch from subdomain to custom domain. I started with Namecheap's instructions which in my opinion wasn't very clear. I then headed to Blogger and Google's Support Forum which again wasn't too clear for a tech idiot like myself. To be honest, Blogger confused me even more. I tried to Google how and went through almost all blogs that discussed how to make the switch. So, putting 2 and 2 together and collectively interlocking all the information from all the sites, I finally was able to actively register my site and create a CNAME record. It took me 3 whole hours. I'm such a dork.How to Change Blogspot Subdomain to Custom Domain from Namecheap1. After purchasing a custom domain from Namecheap and being redirected to dashboard, verify your new custom domain via email address and wait for 10-15 minutes for active status.2. Open a new window and head to your Blogger Blogspot Dashboard, look for \"Settings\", click on \" Basic\".3. Look for Blog Address which will show your Blogspot URL. Underneath it, click on \"+ Setup a third party URL\".A box will open with an http://. Add your custom domain with www.In my case, www.thetiredmamaph.site. At the bottom, click on \" save\".4.An error will show with corresponding codes (see image above). These codes are to be placed as CNAME records for your custom domain. So, open the window of your Namecheap custom domain dashboard. After clicking on domain list, click on Advance DNS which will show your list of Host records. Delete everything there. That was where I was stumped. There were 2 entries under host records after I clicked on \"Advanced DNS\". One was a CNAME pointing to Namecheap and another with the name of my custom domain that had the word \"unmask\". I didn't know if I should delete it or not. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure that one out. It would have been nice if the instructions provided by Namecheap just said delete everything there and proceed with the CNAME records given by Blogger. Just so people like me wouldn't be confused. I mean it's my first time.5.Now, with nothing under Host Records, click on \" add record\". Click CNAME and on the blank beside it under \"Host\", type in www and on the blank beside that under \"Value\", type in ghs.google.com. For TTL, place 30 minutes. 30 minutes is the standard time for domain propagation.6.Click on \"add record\" again and click CNAME again. This time for the blank beside this one for \"Host\", copy and paste the shorter line of jumbled letters and numbers of the second line of CNAME codes provided by Blogger. On the space for \"Value\", copy and paste the longer code that has the wordgooglehostedin it. Again for TTL, place 30 minutes. Please note: this second line of codes is unique for everyone.7. After entering the 2 CNAMEs under host record, you will now add 4 \"A records\" with these four sets of numbers (IP addresses):216.239.32.21,216.239.34.21,216.239.36.21,216.239.38.21.These numbers are to be placed on the blanks under \"Value\". For the spaces under \"Host\", place @ for each.8. All in all, you should have added 6 host records, 2 CNAMEs and 4 A records. Click save. It takes 30 minutes for Namecheap to activate and another 30 minutes for Blogger to verify. Yes, you'll have to wait for an hour. In my case, an hour and thirty minutes. I thought I had problems so I also added a TXT record for Google to verify ownership. Basically, you just have to be patient and wait.9.After an hour and a half of constantly reloading and refreshing Blogger to see if the redirect is active, finally after clicking save for the nth time, it directed to a new box. My new custom domain is now saved with my Blogspot subdomain being redirected. Beside the name of your new custom domain click edit, which will open a checkbox saying domain.com to redirect to www.domain.com. Place a check on that box, click save and you are finally done with the switch.No, the technical stuff doesn't end there...Now, you have to secure your website with an HTTPS connection. For other sites, you will have to purchase an SSL certificate. For Blogger, it is free. Underneath the \"Blog Address\" you were tinkering with to change to a custom domain, you will find HTTPS. From no, click on yes. You will receive a message \" your request is being processed\". It only takes a few minutes.For HTTPS Redirect, also click \"Yes\". Save your settings. Now, It's time to tell Google about the switch.Changing Address on Google Search ConsoleEvery blogger's concern is the loss of traffic (most especially organic traffic) and a decrease in domain authority or ranking and with major changes like this, it is doomed to happen.To minimize a drop, head over to Google Search Console for \"change of address\".First of all, make sure your new site is verified. If your custom domain is already verified, on the \" Home\" page of the Google Search Console dashboard, click on \"add property\" and add your new custom domain. Then, switch back to your Blogspot property that you want to change.. On the right side corner, click on the gear icon (looks like a screw), then click on \"change of address\".This will direct to a Change of Address window for your Blogspot subdomain. First, pick your new site from the list by scrolling down the list of properties,  and click on the new custom domain. Now, you can check if 301 redirects are in place. A green check should appear if everything is in order. Check that verifications are all present for both old and new sites, a green check will appear if everything is in order. Click on \" submit\".  After submitting, you will see this message:\"SubmittedYour request for a site move has succeeded.If you believe this is an error, you can withdraw the request.Return to site dashboard\"I wish I can say that everything is done but, you still have to update any resources on your site such as tags or headers that refer to the old domain. Anyway, we can take it one step at a time.So, I would like to welcome you to a new chapter into my blogging journey. I was able to get my feet wet with my tiredmama-ph.blogspot subdomain and learned a lot. Now, I think I can say I've grown.Thank you for letting me be a part of your lives!Here's to a new beginning!Need this as a reference? Pin it for later!",

        "post_text": "\n\n\n\nPrint Article⎙\nRecently, medicinal herbs and plants have been gaining rapid global attention for their therapeutic potential. Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only. Do consult your physician for medical advice.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Based on YouGov PH, a known survey site, the preferred e-commerce site according to respondents of a recent survey regarding online-shopping here in the Philippines is <b>Lazada</b>. I, for one, am a patron of this e-commerce site. And now shopping online on Lazada is even better thanks to an app called <b>\"Pera Swipe\"</b> (literally translates to \"money swipe\").</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThere are things that I can only get from Manila and to do so, I shop online on Lazada. You can take this as a testimonial of sorts because for one thing, I live all the way here in Davao City. With the added distance from Manila, chances are items being delivered can get 'lost in translation'. Or, they can get damaged due to mishandling. So far, Lazada has not let me down. Items are well wrapped, brand new, and in good condition upon arrival at my front door. I guess, the addition of a minimal \" shipping fee\" assures delivery of my purchased items in good condition or I'm just lucky. I hope it's because of the former.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F3jQqvM9qn4/W2apCSDSi2I/AAAAAAAAEJo/3qL5yYlkWn0qALxS8VNXboWWLGqz8AQ1wCKgBGAs/s1600/20180804_161900_0001.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1102\" data-original-width=\"735\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F3jQqvM9qn4/W2apCSDSi2I/AAAAAAAAEJo/3qL5yYlkWn0qALxS8VNXboWWLGqz8AQ1wCKgBGAs/s640/20180804_161900_0001.png\" width=\"426\"/></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<br/></div>\n<br/></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWhy shop on Lazada?</h3>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nActually, the main reason why I shop online using Lazada is the methods of payment. Lazada accepts payments made through PayPal and they also do COD (cash on delivery). I usually make my payment through PayPal. PayPal holds the money that I receive from online work. So, instead of tapping into the usual household's finances, I use the PayPal money to pay for online purchases.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<span style=\"background-color: #ead1dc;\"><span style='font-family: \"arial\" , \"helvetica\" , sans-serif;'><span style=\"color: white;\">[Read</span>: <a href=\"https://tiredmama-ph.blogspot.com/2018/07/legit-online-survey-sites-philippines.html\" target=\"_blank\">Legit Online Survey Sites Open for Philippine Residents</a>]</span></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<b>Other reasons why you should shop on Lazada are:</b></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<br/></div>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada always has a promo or a sale going on with many items at discounted prices. There are a lot of really good deals that you can get. Many of the discounted items are those usually needed by mothers like baby items, formula, toys, children's clothing, school supplies and bags even diapers and baby wipes. I missed out on a great deal on an HP printer. It sold for under 1000Php (under $20 USD) and since it was cheap, went out of stock quickly.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada provides shoppers with reliable and fast delivery and a tracking code for items being shipped so you can track your package. They also send you an email notification if the package is to be delivered within 24 hours so you know when to wait for your item. If, however, you can not claim the package yourself, you just have to either print out a copy of the confirmation email sent to you by Lazada with all the necessary details of your purchase or write an authorization letter authorizing whomever it is you have waiting to receive your package. Do remember to leave an ID with your authorized representative to support your claim.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada provides shoppers with vouchers or coupons so you can get a discount on top of what the site is already offering you. As a welcome gift for new users of the Lazada app, the site gives a 100 Php voucher. You can search for vouchers using the Lazada mobile app.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada hasn't had many issues regarding scams. I have seen some stories circulating on social media sites about being scammed by Lazada but, none of them were confirmed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada makes refunds. Apparently, an item that I purchased which was part of their Taobao collection (Taobao is a popular e-commerce site in China) went out of stock. After receiving my email notification that they would be refunding the money, a minute later, my money was back in my PayPal account. </li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada offers items from Taobao e-commerce site as part of their Taobao Collection without any additional shipping fees since items are from China and Korea. Also, they offer special discounts for items in this collection.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lazada offers shoppers reviews from verified purchases made by other shoppers. After your item has been delivered, Lazada will send you an email asking you to give a short review of your experience. You can give a rate of 1 star-5 stars for the item and the seller separately and write a short comment why you rate them that way. This gives shoppers insight into whether or not it is a good buy and to put your minds at ease if you are worried about being scammed.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, Lazada partnered with the Pera Swipe app allows you to get weekly discount vouchers without any minimum purchase, a cash back on purchases made, and so much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Khj-mVpCWgU/W2VkJjguySI/AAAAAAAAEH0/p1NVhN3f_WotOG3JNM-t3kkg6E-YW_2owCKgBGAs/s1600/20180804_162645_0001.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"756\" data-original-width=\"945\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Khj-mVpCWgU/W2VkJjguySI/AAAAAAAAEH0/p1NVhN3f_WotOG3JNM-t3kkg6E-YW_2owCKgBGAs/s640/20180804_162645_0001.png\" width=\"640\"/></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style='color: #666666; font-family: \"arial\" , \"helvetica\" , sans-serif; font-size: x-small;'>Some of my recent purchases from Lazada. a.)

Basically, you earn \"money\" from swiping although the points earned with their cash equivalent doesn't translate to actual money in your hands.

You earn points by swiping ads on your lock screen. The catch is you have to be online (either through wi-fi or cellular data) for your points to be counted.  More swiping means more points and more points equates to a bigger cash equivalent. \"Pera Swipe\" also provide tasks in the form of \"events\" that allows users to earn more points aside from the usual swiping since there is a limit on how many points you can accumulate via swiping in a day. You can also get the chance to win movie tickets for upcoming flicks through some of Pera Swipe's events. Sometimes, Pera Swipe offers a \"Swipe for 1000 Points\" day that allows you to swipe up to 1000 points. Points earned can be used to buy prepaid credits for your phone, top-ups for Cliqq App (7-Eleven) or Lazada e-wallet, and for gamers, top-ups for certain online games.  As for shopping online on Lazada, you can get weekly vouchers that offer a discount without any minimum purchase, you can get a 5%-10% cash back on certain purchases, and now as of their recent update, you can also top-up your Lazada e-wallet to make more purchases. Also, users have a chance of winning more points by sharing their shopping experience purchasing items on Lazada through this amazing app. 50,000 points await the lucky winner that shares their testimonial using Lazada via the Pera Swipe app.</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sj-PpzXYon4/W2apV1UEKdI/AAAAAAAAEJw/tKJyDI9wa7g6bNg6g2YdgzTzVqO9O3ysQCKgBGAs/s1600/20180805_151550_0001.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"756\" data-original-width=\"945\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sj-PpzXYon4/W2apV1UEKdI/AAAAAAAAEJw/tKJyDI9wa7g6bNg6g2YdgzTzVqO9O3ysQCKgBGAs/s640/20180805_151550_0001.png\" width=\"640\"/></a></div>\n<br/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nHow to activate Lazada e-wallet<br/>\n<br/>\nThe newest update of Pera Swipe now has more choices for you on how to use your points.

Based on YouGov PH, a known survey site, the preferred e-commerce site according to respondents of a recent survey regarding online-shopping here in the Philippines isLazada. I, for one, am a patron of this e-commerce site. And now shopping online on Lazada is even better thanks to an app called\"Pera Swipe\"(literally translates to \"money swipe\").There are things that I can only get from Manila and to do so, I shop online on Lazada. You can take this as a testimonial of sorts because for one thing, I live all the way here in Davao City. With the added distance from Manila, chances are items being delivered can get 'lost in translation'. Or, they can get damaged due to mishandling. So far, Lazada has not let me down. Items are well wrapped, brand new, and in good condition upon arrival at my front door. I guess, the addition of a minimal \" shipping fee\" assures delivery of my purchased items in good condition or I'm just lucky. I hope it's because of the former.Why shop on Lazada?Actually, the main reason why I shop online using Lazada is the methods of payment. Lazada accepts payments made through PayPal and they also do COD (cash on delivery). I usually make my payment through PayPal. PayPal holds the money that I receive from online work. So, instead of tapping into the usual household's finances, I use the PayPal money to pay for online purchases.[Read:Legit Online Survey Sites Open for Philippine Residents]Other reasons why you should shop on Lazada are:Lazada always has a promo or a sale going on with many items at discounted prices. There are a lot of really good deals that you can get. Many of the discounted items are those usually needed by mothers like baby items, formula, toys, children's clothing, school supplies and bags even diapers and baby wipes. I missed out on a great deal on an HP printer. It sold for under 1000Php (under $20 USD) and since it was cheap, went out of stock quickly.Lazada provides shoppers with reliable and fast delivery and a tracking code for items being shipped so you can track your package. They also send you an email notification if the package is to be delivered within 24 hours so you know when to wait for your item. If, however, you can not claim the package yourself, you just have to either print out a copy of the confirmation email sent to you by Lazada with all the necessary details of your purchase or write an authorization letter authorizing whomever it is you have waiting to receive your package.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau. Common name: Sabah Snake Grass by Mokkie (via Wikimedia Commons) is licenced under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\n\n5. Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.

Just late last year, Indian goosegrass became a trending topic when a Filipina posted on her social media account that she had miraculously expelled a cyst after drinking a decoction of goosegrass. Now, the attention has turned to Sabah snake grass and its anti-cancer potential after a man who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic Cancer posted also on social media that after ingesting leaves of the Sabah snake grass plant, his terminal disease had miraculously disappeared. Whether this is a marketing strategy or ploy or not, it seems that everyone has now become curious whether or not this plant can do what this man testifies it can do. As I said before, everyone is looking for a miracle. This man, like the woman with goosegrass, has luckily found his. \n\n\n\n\n\nMedicinal plants are becoming popular because they provide mankind with inexpensive natural products versus processed chemicals that are widely used in drugs today. As such, these plants are seen as a rich source of potential therapeutic compounds that if prepared right, can help us with what ails us. Now that plant-based drug development has become sophisticated with modern chemists being able to isolate those compounds with medicinal benefits without the added toxicity nor resistance that chemical-based drugs are known to exhibit, it is not a wonder that plants are now the focus of extensive studies and research regarding a wide range of biological activities, that is, their antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass became popular 5 years ago after similar testimonies were posted, so it is no surprise that it has now been resurrected to create a stir- again. The thing is, since then, Sabah snake grass has undergone significant research and its potential has somewhat been studied. I again have taken the liberty to write about what I have researched regarding this plant and I hope I can clarify some preconceived notions regarding the Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikipedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nSabah Snake Grass Botany and General Information\n\n\nClinacanthus nutans\nSabah snake grass is a perennial herb with the scientific name, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau, and belongs to the Acanthaceae family which is considered as the largest source of medicinal plants that can provide effective traditional medicines (ethnomedicinal) against certain diseases and health issues. Sabah snake grass is endemic to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China, and is widely used in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Brunei, and Indonesia. Traditionally, it is popular as a remedy for snake bites and is recognized by traditional Thai healers for its anti-snake venom activity. Common vernacular names of Clinacanthus nutans are Sabah snake grass in English derived from its ability as a remedy for snake bites, belalai gajah in Malay, phaya yo/ phaya plongtong/ saled pangpon tua mea/ biphya yaw in Thai, e zuihua/ sha be she cao/ you dun cao in China, and dandang gendis or ki tajam in Indonesia.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass is an herbaceous shrub that can grow up to 1-3m in height. The leaves have a pointed apex with its margins either exsculptate-dentate or subentire and are lanceolate, narrow, and long with a leaf base that is rounded and pubescent on the nerves. The leaves are oppositely arranged on stems that are woody, green, cylindrical, upright, striated and smooth.\n\nThe flowers of the Clinacanthus nutans are arranged in a cyme which in Botany is an inflorescence (arrangement of flowers on a plant) in which the first flower is the terminal flower of the main stem and all subsequent flowers that develop are terminal flowers of the lateral stems. Cymes of the Sabah snake grass usually compose of 5-8 flowers. The flower (as seen below)  comprises a dark red corolla with a green base, a yellow lower lip that is positioned upwards, 2 stamens, and a compacted 2-cell ovary with 2 ovules in each cell. Flowers are panicle-shaped with tube-shaped elongated petals and are approximately 4-6cm long. The Sabah snake grass plant can be propagated through stem cutting. It is said that flowers of the plant are rare due to the commercial use of the plant's leaves. It is believed that most of its curative abilities lie within its leaves and because of this, extensive harvesting of leaves may hinder the plant to grow into maturity resulting in the lack of flowers. Thus, little is known about how long it takes for the Sabah snake grass plant to mature, flower, and fruit.\n*Click here for the image of leaves, stem, and flower.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans by Vinayaraj (via Wikimedia Commons) is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nPhytochemistry of Sabah snake grass\n\nSabah snake grass has been the focus of extensive studies and research and along with it has resulted in the isolation of various phytoconstituents that are believed to be the source of Sabah snake grass's therapeutic abilities. The presence of 4 sulfur-containing compounds, 2 glycerolipids, a flavanol, 6 known flavones, 4 flavonols, 2 phytosterols, a polypeptide, 9 cerebrosides and various phenolics and fatty acids contribute as sources of a wide range of diverse bioactivities.  These compounds are as follows:\n\n\nVitexin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsovitexin  (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nOrientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nIsoorientin (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nShaftoside (Chelyn et al. 2014); (Huang et al. 2015); (Khoo et al.2015)- C-glycosyl flavone\nClinacoside A (Teshima et al. 1998)-sulfurous glycoside\nClinacoside B (Teshima et al. 1998)- sulfurous glycoside\nClinamide A (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide B (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\nClinamide C (Tu et al. 2014)- a sulfur-containing compound\n13₂ -hydroxy-(13₂ -S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2009)\n(3β)-Lup-20(29)-en-3-ol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nBeta-sitoserol  (Dampawan et al. 1977)\nIsomollupentin 7-O-β-glucopyranoside (Chelyn et al. 2014)- C-glycosyl flavone\n2-cis-Entadamide A and Entadamide A  (Tu et al. 2014)\nShaftoside (Apigenin 6-C-β-o-glucopyranosyl-8- C-α-L-arabinopyranoside) (Huang et al. 2015)- flavonoid\nApigenin 6,8-C-α-L-pyranarabinoside (Huang et al. 2015)\nGendarucin A (Khoo et al. 2015)\n3,3-di-O-methylellagic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\nascorbic acid (Khoo et al. 2015)\noxoprolinates (Khoo et al. 2015)\ncerebrosides (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\nEntadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)\nEntadamide C (Tu et al. 2014)   \n2-cis-entadamide A (Tu et al. 2014)-a sulfur-containing compound  \ntrans -3-methylsulfinyl-2-propenol (Tu et al. 2014)\n(2S)-1-O-linolenoyl-3-O-b-dgalactopyranosylglycerol (Tuntiwachwuttikul et al. 2004)\ntrigalactosyl and digalactosyl diglycerides (Janwitayanuchit et al. 2003) - compounds which are anti-HSV effective\n13-hydroxy-(13-S)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin b (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-R)-phaeophytin a  (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n132-hydroxy-(132-S)-phaeophytin a (Sakdarat et al. 2006)\n\n\n*Click here for the chemical structures of the compounds found in Sabah snake grass.\n\n\nThe overwhelming amount of phytochemical investigations that have documented the various bioactive compound of the Sabah snake grass can attest to its ability as a medicinal plant. Isolation of saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, diterpenes, and phytosterols (Yang et al. 2013), glycosides, glycoglycerolipids, cerebrosides, and monoacylmonogalatosylglycerol are the main basis for the pharmacological attributes of Clinacanthus nutans. These compounds extracted from the Sabah snake grass exhibit a wide range of biological therapeutic properties namely antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complete phytochemical profile of this plant as well as their modes of action regarding these biological activities.\nIn 2015, Raya and his colleagues assessed the effects of storage duration on the phytochemical content of Sabah snake grass leaves and stem at different stages of harvesting. They found that phenolic content was 26% and 90% higher in younger leaves and stem as to their mature counterparts. Additionally, mature plants had a lower content of phytochemicals, chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid than younger plants. They also concluded that prolonged storage reduced levels of these important phytochemical consituents of the Clinacanthus nutans. Their research stated that after 4 days of storage, the total phenolic and chlorophyll content reduced by 50% and 25% for leaves and stem compared to those that were newly harvested. Thus, for optimum efficacy, fresh plant parts should be used.\nThe oral toxicity of the plant has also been studied on mice and rats and these studies have revealed that Sabah snake grass is safe for consumption as it did not produce any signs of toxicity in animals (Toxicological Study of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. F.) Lindau (Chavalittumrong et al. 1995)).\n\n\nAcanthaceae-Clinacanthus nutans by VanLap Hoang is licensed under CC BY 2.0\n\n \n\nHealth Benefits and Medicinal Uses of Sabah Snake Grass\n1. Sabah snake grass is rich in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and many essential minerals. \n Surprisingly, Sabah snake grass contains many essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, zinc, copper manganese, nickel, and 17 amino acids which are needed by our bodies. Moreover, it has a rich content of Vitamin C, protein, and dietary fiber. Consumption of dietary fiber aids in digestion, plays a role in regulating blood sugar level, and helps prevent atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Because of its nutritional content alone, Sabah snake grass is effective for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, and high cholesterol and is effective as an antioxidant due to the scavenging ability of Vitamin C.\nClinacanthus nutans tea was reported to have a good percentage of carbohydrates, crude protein (more than 45%), minerals, both essential and non-essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids.\n\n2. Anti-inflammatory\n Sabah snake grass has been used to reduce inflammation from insect bites, lesions from Herpes Simplex Virus and common allergic symptoms in traditional medicine.\nIn the study, The anti-inflammatory effects and the inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness by Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans extracts, it concluded that both extracts induced powerful dose-dependent inhibitory effects in edema-induced rats. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of neutrophil responsiveness. (Wanikiat et al. 2008)\nAnother study was done in 2014 (Tu et al.), Chemical Constituents and Bioactivities of Clinacanthus nutans Aerial Plants, the authors were able to provide data on the inhibition of elastase by 4 sulfur-containing bioactive compounds. Clinamides A-C and 2-cis-entadamide A were isolated and extracts were found to inhibit 68.33% of elastase release from human neutrophils at 10 μg/ml.\nAnother notable study (Mai et al. 2016), demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids from extracts of the Sabah snake grass.\n3. Anti-dengue activity and Anti-influenza Avtivity\n In relation to their study of bioactive compounds of C. nutans aerial plants, Tu and his colleagues found that ethanolic extracts showed moderate anti-dengue virus activity with an IC50 (concentration of drug at which 50% of your target is inhibited) of 31.04 μg/ml. This is comforting to know ( and promising) that there is a plant that can help fight the dengue virus. Here in the Philippines, many children die from the virus every year. Hopefully, the Department of Health and Philippine scientists can look into this.\nInfluenza virus infection is a highly communicable disease that has a high mortality and morbidity rate and is a cause for concern when it becomes a pandemic outbreak. The usual causes of the global outbreak of Influenza are Influenza A or B. The H1N1 virus that became a pandemic in 2009 (classified by the WHO as H1N1/09) is an Influenza A virus. A study was conducted to see the effectivity of C. siamensis (a synonym of C. nutans) leaf extract on the Influenza Virus (Wirotesangthong et al. 2009) and the study reported that C. siamensis had an inhibitory action on Influenza virus NA (neuraminadase also known as sialidase which catalyzes cleavage of a terminal sialic acid residue from the sialoglycoconjugate receptor causing the release of progeny from the infected cell), an anti-influenza activity in vitro and a protective effect in vivo. In short, it has a potential of protecting against Influenza virus infection\n4. Anti- Herpes Simplex Virus and anti-Varicella Zoster Virus activity\n Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used by indigenous people for the treatment of various infectious diseases including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infections. Today, acyclovir is the treatment of choice for HSV. This mode of treatment is expensive and for those who hail from developing countries, such as some here in South East Asia, cannot afford expensive treatments as such. Thus, these people turn to medicinal plants that are native to the area as an alternative medicine.\nIn the study, Anti-Herpes Simplex Virus activities of monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride from Clinacanthus nutans, a traditional Thai herbal medicine ( Pongmuangmul et al. 2016), the antiviral activity of chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and digalactosyl diglyceride (DGDG) from Sabah snake grass were investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 on Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cells). \nHere, the authors found that: \na.) pre-treatment of Vero cells with chloroform crude extract, extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG 24 hours before viral infection showed 50% protective effect against the HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection process;\nb.) extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG from C. nutans demonstrated 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication at the post-infection step at subtoxic levels and that activity was at the same level as standard MGDG and DGDG samples; \nc.) extracted and purified compounds from the plant exhibited moderate anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activity;\nd.) chloroform crude extract was shown to be less effective against HSV-1 and HSV-2 than the extracted and purified MGDG and DGDG.\nThe authors postulated that monogalactosyl diglyceride and digalactosyl diglyceride are one of the main contributors towards the inhibition of HSV replication and are most effective in the post step of infection. They added that even if the mechanism is still yet unclear, a report demonstrated that some monoglycerides showed antiviral activities by the destruction of viral envelopes of enveloped viruses. Earlier studies of C. nutans have reported that the chlorophyll derivatives (phaeophytins) also exhibit anti-herpes simplex virus activity (Sakdarat et al. 2009) and mode of action is potentially through herpes virus inactivation and inhibition at preinfection (Vachirayonstien et al. 2012).\n Sangkitporn et al. (1995) performed a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the topical formulation of Clinacanthus nutans on 51 patients with Varicella zoster infection. Patients were asked to apply the study medication 5 times a day for a period of 7-14 days. Results published in Treatment of Herpes Zoster with Clinacanthus nutans (BiPhya Yaw) extract stated that the number of patients with lesion crusting within 3 days and with lesion healing within 7 days and 10 days were significantly greater in the C. nutans extract-treated group than that of the controlled. Moreover, pain sores were reduced more rapidly in the C. nutans extracts treatment group. The authors also stated that no side effects were reported.\nCreams made with Sabah snake grass are able to dry out HSV- and VZV-lesions in 3 days.\n\n\nEnglish: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.)

Anti-cancer\n The anti-cancer activity of Sabah snake grass is of a growing interest globally. As such, some studies have focused their effort in unraveling the potential of Clinacanthus nutans as a potential cancer treatment.\nOne focus is the antiproliferative ability of compounds or extracts, that is, the ability to inhibit cell growth and reproduction which in turn can be used as a potential cancer treatment. Three studies have reported that C. nutans leaf extracts inhibited proliferation of a number of cell types including HeLa cell line. Unfortunately, only a few have studied the effects of Sabah snake grass on primary cell types with one study detecting no antiproliferative activity on human gingival fibroblasts (Roeslan et al. 2012).\nWhile antiproliferative active compounds inhibit cancer cell growth and reproduction, antitumorigenic compounds prevent the development, maturation or spread of cancerous cells. One study, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice Through Regulation of the Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), reported the potential antitumorigenic activity of C. nutans. In this study, the authors stated that there was a significant reduction of tumor growth in a mouse hepatoma model. Upon analysis, high levels of Bax (pro-apoptotic mediator) and caspase 3 (apoptotic executioner protein) were found in the C. nutans treated mice. This suggests that Sabah snake grass induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) as its mechanism to halt cell proliferation in tumor growth.\nOne notable study, Clinacanthus nutans Extracts Are Antioxidant with Antiproliferative Effect on Cultured Human Cancer Cell Lines (Yong et al. 2013), here the authors evaluated the antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of C. nutans on 8 human cancer cell lines namely: human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32), human lung cancer cell line (NHI-H23), human gastric cancer cell line (SNU-1), human colon cancer adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-174T), human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji), and normal cell and human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Here the authors of the study reported:\na.) C. nutans in chloroform extract was a good antioxidant against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and galvinoxyl radicals but less effective on nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals.\nb.) Chloroform extract of the plant exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human erythroleukemia cell line and human Burkitt's Lymphoma cell line at 100 μg/ml but failed to suppress the proliferation of human neuroblastoma cell line. The rest in a concentration-dependent manner.\nc.) IC50 values fell above the recommended value of the National Cancer Institute for crude extract (<20 μg/ml) suggesting that C. nutans chloroform extract is not a strong anticancer regimen.\nd.) inhibitory and antioxidant effects suggest the potential of C. nutans as an alternate adjunctive or chemopreventative regimen.\nAlthough most studies make use of the leaves and stem of the Sabah snake grass, I found a study that made use of the root (Chemical Composition and cytotoxic properties of Clinacanthus Root extracts (Teoh et al. 2016)) on human cancer cell lines. Its findings were that root extracts were selective towards cancer cells and did not affect the proliferation of normal cells.\n 6. Antivenom\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Sabah snake grass has been used by traditional Thai healers and Malays as a remedy for envenomation snakes or venomous insects (scorpions, bees). Although a previous study \"The Absence of Antagonism between extracts of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) and Naja naja siamensis venom\" (Cherdchu et al. 1977) concluded that the extract of C. nutans can not antagonize the action of cobra venom since it was found to have no effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission produced by purified N.n siamensis neurotoxin in isolated rat phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations, a report in Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice stated that there are components in the venom of these animals/insects that can be neutralized by the extract of the plant. Watson (from Botanical Medicine in Clinical Practice) cited the possibility of anti-cell lysis as an explanation thus, it is believed that the antivenin mechanism of action of the Sabah snake grass is attributed to its anti-cell lysis property rather than as an anti-neuromuscular transmission blocker.\nConsequently, Uawonggul et al. 2006 screened 64 plant species listed as either an animal- or insect-bite antidote in old Thai drug recipes for their activity against fibroblast cell lysis after Heterometrus laoticus venom treatment. Uawonggul et al. listed a number of plants including C. nutans stating that the listed plants had a tendency to be scorpion venom antidotes.\n\n7. Anti-microbial\n\nDue to the rise of resistance to commercially produced antibacterials and antimicrobials, scientists are now leaning towards natural products to combat illness from bacteria and fungi. Of course, since Sabah snake grass is known in traditional Asian medicine as an anti-viral, scientists are now testing for anti-microbial properties as well.\nI have chanced upon a study that included C. nutans in its list of selected plants and to test their anti-microbial activity, unfortunately, Sabah snake grass did not stand out (Wong et al. 2013). Others that have conducted studies on C.nutans solely for its anti-microbial activity, reported that Clinacanthus nutans possess significant antibacterial effect against S.aureus and E.coli due to bioactive compounds saponins, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, diterpenes and phytosterols (Yang et.al 2013); F7 MIC 1.39mg/ml for B. cereus, E.coli, C. albicans, Salmonella entericum Typhium demonstrating inhibition   (Arullappan et al. 2014); flavonoids and phenolic compounds that are synthesized universally in medicinal plants can induce antibacterial response due to the presence of a carbonyl group (Rathee et al. 2009).\n 8. As treatment for canker sores\n\nA clinical trial was done with 43 patients for the efficacy of C. nutans in orabase for recurrent apthous stomatitis (canker cores) and it was found that C. nutans in orabase was more effective than placebo but less effective than triamcinolone acetonide in orabase. Apthous stomatitis is common and is characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals.  \n  9. Ethnomedicinal Uses of Sabah snake grass\n As its names implies, Sabah snake grass is a well-known plant used for snake bites by traditional Thai healers. It is also used for scorpion bites and nettle rash. Some make use of Sabah snake grass to treat fever. It has also been used to treat the following health problems: a sore throat, gout, uric acid, uterine fibroids, kidney problems, prostate inflammation, as well as known skin problems such as shingles, eczema, and psoriasis.\n Moreover, traditional Indonesian and Thai healers use Sabah Snake grass to treat dysentery. A handful of leaves are boiled in 5 glasses of water until water level recedes to 3 glasses and the decoction is given 1 glass 3 times daily. For diabetes, 7-21 fresh leaves are boiled in 2 glasses of water until water level recedes to 1 glass and is given half a glass twice daily. For dysuria, 15g of fresh leaves are boiled for 15 minutes and is consumed once daily.\n \nIn China, Sabah snake grass is used in controlling menstrual function, relieving pain, anemia, jaundice, and setting of fractured bones.\n 10. Immunomodulatory Activity\n In the study, Clincanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau Ethanol Extract Inhibits Hepatoma in Mice through Upregulation of Immune Response (Huang et al. 2015), the authors concluded that their results suggest that C. nutans has potential antitumor and immunomodulatory properties with the 30% ethanol extract of C. nutans displaying an indirect antitumor activity by enhancing immunologic functions. \n In addition to this, the effects of the extract of the leaves of C. nutans on modulating cell-mediated response by observing human competent cells obtained from a healthy human with no previous medical history of immune-related illnesses and with no intake of immunosuppressive medications were also studied. It was found that there was an induced proliferation of lymphocytes at concentrations of 0.5 but decreased at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Natural Killer cells also decreased at concentrations of 1 and 5 mg/ml, however, interleukin-4 was induced at concentrations 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml. Interleukin-4 has an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxicity of Natural Killer cells and may explain why lymphocyte proliferation decreased at increased concentrations. The authors concluded that their study reveals evidence of alteration of non-specific cell-mediated response by the extract of C. nutans and may explain the mechanism of its effect on viral infections. (Effects of Clinacanthus nutans on human cell-mediated immune response in vitro, Sriwanthana et al. 1996)\n I also read that Sabah snake grass can also effectively activate the body's immune system, increase the count of white blood cells, produce endogenous interferon, increase anti-tumor mechanism. This plant is also said to promote cell growth and revive certain level of immune system after the damages caused by chemotherapy to the body. This all warrants more research.\n\n\n\nSabah snake grass today\n\nDue to recent claims as an anti-cancer remedy, many commercial products with Sabah snake grass have arisen and are now being sold worldwide. You can now find Sabah snake grass in products such as tea, soap, ointments, drops, lip balm, and other products. Although more studies and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint the phytoconstituents that induce the therapeutic effects, the mode or mechanism of which these compounds exhibit, in vitro and in vivo, the testimonies of those who have used this plant and have been cured is the basis why others are turning their attention to Sabah snake grass. Patients with these cancers namely lung, uterus, prostate, breast, and leukemia and those who are undergoing dialysis, suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hugh uric acid and diabetes have attributed to the wonders of Sabah snake grass.\n As a cancer treatment, fresh leaves should be used with the number of leaves increasing by stage: (cited by Singapore Sabah Snake Grass)\nStage 1 CA: 30 leaves per day\nStage 2 CA: 50 leaves per day\nStage 3 CA: 100 leaves per day\nStage 4 CA: 150-200 leaves per day\n\n\nThere are 2 methods on how to take Sabah snake grass leaves. You can consume leaves directly as a salad or make juice.\nMethod 1: Eat leaves directly. For those with Cancer Stages 1-4 (Cited by SSG Anticancer Philippines)\nWash 10 or more leaves of Sabah snake grass and eat like a fresh salad. Do this 3 times a day. \n Method 2: As juice.\n\nDirections for juicing Sabah Snake Grass:\na) Pour half cup of clean water in a blenderb) Add 1 or 2 ice cubes to prevent heating during blendingc) Add 1 quarter of lemon or half a lime juice (provide Vitamin C to prevent oxidization. Calamansi is too acidic and should not be used. )d) Wash the required fresh SSG leaves and put them into the blendere) Peel a green apple and remove the core/seedsf ) Cut the apple into 8 piecesg) Put in the pieces of apple and blendh) Swish and drink with the fiber immediately or within 5 minutes.i) Consume it every day.j) If your body is \"cooling\" add a slice of ginger or drink warming herb.\n*Singapore Sabah Snake Grass\n You may also use soursop or guyabano instead of green apple. \n\nFor maintenance (adjunctive treatment): (cited from Sabah snake grass- Anti-cancer Philippines)- take 10-15 leaves daily\n\nHealthy people according to SSG Anticancer Philippines can take 10 leaves per day. They recommend taking it as a salad.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the result of the Sabah snake grass treatment for cancer depends on the quantity of the Sabah snake grass taken and form whether fresh, dried or commercial tea and whether the patient is taking any other medicinal herbs such as ginseng. Also, differing body conditions and types of blood among patients may cause an anti-cancer herb to either work differently or not work at all.  According to some, C. nutans partnered with Stobilanthes crispus is a more potent remedy or another herb known as Elephantes scaber (dila-dila in Filipino) may be more effective.\n\nPlease note when consuming Sabah snake grass in high amounts (more than 300 leaves per day), the body may experience a \"cooling effect\". Symptoms are coughing, pain in thighs and knees, insomnia, restless legs, weak knees, and back pain.\n*Click on this study and look for Table 2: Traditional and Modern Uses of Clincanthus nutans.\n\nPlease note that you should avoid these when taking Sabah snake grass: ginseng, other rejuvenating herbs, sugar including products made with sugar, honey, durian, bird's nest, duck meat, margarine, glutenous rice, kembong fish, ray fish, angled-fish, and chicken meat.\n\nThere is underlying evidence that Sabah snake grass has many therapeutic uses. Before taking any herbal medicine, make sure to do your homework and consult with your physician. Stay healthy and happy!\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I, The Tired Mama PH, am not endorsing the use of Sabah Snake Grass. This post has been written for educational purposes only.
