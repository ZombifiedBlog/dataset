And if you have ever thought about expanding your customer base to international customers, you have also had similar insecurities.

It is why more and more businesses are now turning to transliteration for their business communication. But,</span> <b>what is transliteration</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? And why is it better suited for address verification?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, we elaborate on</span> <b>what does transliteration mean</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and its best features. Furthermore, we also discuss the difference between translation and transliteration and explain why the latter could be a better choice for your business.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h2 id=\"heading2\">What Is Transliteration?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transliteration is the process of converting text from one language to another. Although it sounds like translation,</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are not the same. The primary difference between the two is the underlying meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you translate a text or language, you still end up with meaningful words and sentences. In other words, you can maintain the underlying meaning in the original language in translation. But when it comes to transliteration, the underlying purpose is lost more often than not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can guess, there is a reason why</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are so different despite being so similar. Perhaps the underlying meaning is lost in transliteration because of the literal conversion of characters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, transliteration switches a text or character from one language to another without bothering about the underlying meaning. Translation, as you know, is slightly more complex. But, we will discuss all the similarities and differences between</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the coming sections.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"seobox\">\n<h2 id=\"heading3\">What Does Transliteration Mean In Address Verification?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have a clear idea of</span> <b>what is transliteration</b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">let’s look at its significance in</span> <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/address-verification/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address verification</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As you can guess, transliteration (or translation for that matter) is only applicable when a business deals with international customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it doesn’t apply to all international customers either. Perhaps, it is more apt to say that</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in address verification are applicable only when you deal with non-English speaking, global audiences.</span></p>\n<h3>International Address Database</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can benefit from transliteration if your business has a customer base that extends beyond English-speaking countries. In this case, you likely have your international customers’ addresses in their native language. You can already see why</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are essential here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major challenge, of course, is to figure out the location of your customers using the address in Russian, Japanese, Arabic, etc. Imagine how much easier it would be for your business operations to spell the address in your native language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can imagine, both</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tools can come in handy in such a situation. Of course, implementing the same is easier said than done, even if you are using relatively simple transliteration for address verification.</span></p>\n<h3>CRM Compatibility</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can’t just integrate an address verification solution into your business and hope it works. The essential thing you need to check is that your CRM software can support other languages. At the very least, you should ensure that your CRM can keep all the relevant languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it would be best for you to ensure a CRM that can support additional languages. Doing so helps you with the potential customer base you wish to target in the future. On the other hand, if you already have an advanced CRM system, then implementing</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is relatively easy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A better CRM will allow you to enhance your business capabilities beyond</span> transliteration and translation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It allows you to run <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/direct-mail/\">advanced</a></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/direct-mail/\">direct mail</a> campaigns</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to send personalised communication/marketing materials to your international audiences.</span></p>\n<h3>Address Parsing And Address Standardisation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways address verification tools like PostGrid can benefit your business is with its advanced address parsing and standardisation capability. Our system can break down your domestic and international addresses into small units and rearrange them into a standard format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can imagine, the process makes</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of your addresses easier. A country’s official postal service provider decides the standard address format for sending postal mail within that country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the AusPost defines the standard address format for mailing in Australia. Similarly, USPS defines the standard address format in the US, Royal Mail in the UK, etc.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 25px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img-with-aniamtion-wrap center\" data-animation=\"fade-in\" data-border-radius=\"none\" data-max-width=\"100%\" data-max-width-mobile=\"default\" data-shadow=\"none\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"hover-wrap\" data-hover-animation=\"none\">\n<div class=\"hover-wrap-inner\"><a class=\"center\" href=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/how-it-works/\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"direct mail operations\" class=\"img-with-animation skip-lazy\" data-animation=\"fade-in\" data-delay=\"0\" height=\"497\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1450px) 75vw, (min-width: 1000px) 85vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/direct-mail-operations-cta-1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.postgrid.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/direct-mail-operations-cta-1.png 1024w, https://www.postgrid.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/direct-mail-operations-cta-1-300x146.png 300w, https://www.postgrid.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/direct-mail-operations-cta-1-768x373.png 768w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 25px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading4\" style=\"text-align: left\">Explaining What Is Transliteration With Examples</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to understand</span> what is transliteration <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and how it can affect your business communication is through examples. And we don’t blame you if you are still unsure about the concept of transliteration because it is often confusing to everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the good news is that we will help you clarify these confusions. We will help you understand</span> what does transliteration <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mean for your business using simple examples. However, it might be a good idea to brush up on your Japanese because the word for the day is KONNICHIWA!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who have no clue about the Japanese language, KONNICHIWA roughly translates to a greeting like “hello.” And if you were to translate KONNICHIWA to English, it would say hello or good morning. But anyway, we are here to talk about transliteration and not translation.</span></p>\n<h3>Conversion In Transliteration</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“こんにちは”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What may seem like random symbols you see above is KONNICHIWA in the native Japanese language. Now any</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">process involves a conversion process. Although both approaches may seem similar, the results of the two methods can often be staggeringly different. The following table should help you understand the conversion process here.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Japanese Character</b></td>\n<td><b>Equivalent Sound Of The Character</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">こ</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KO</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ん</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">N</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">に</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NI</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ち</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CHI</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">は</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HA or WA</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned, transliteration merely gives you the character equivalent of the input language. Even though the conversion process is standard in</span> transliteration and translation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the result here varies significantly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before we explain</span> what is the difference between a translation and a transliteration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, let us consider the transliteration conversion. Everything goes smooth with transliterating KONNICHIWA from Japanese to English until you reach the last character は.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, here, things spice up a little in the conversion process because は has two sounds when you transliterate it. The two possible sounds of the character は are HA and WA.</span></p>\n<h3>Different Phonetic Matches In Transliteration</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were talking about a single character (は) having different phonetic matches. It is evident from this example that transliteration also depends on the context. But does that mean</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are more similar than we think?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the context matters here, there is no way of knowing which. But, to help yourself understand the concept better, think of は like the letter C in “cold” and “city.” As you can see, even though you are using the same letter or character, the sound can be entirely different.</span></p>\n<h3>Transliteration Can Vary With The Country</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the official language of the two countries is the same, it is not necessary to have the exact transliteration for the characters. It is another noteworthy difference between</span> transliteration and translation. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation remains somewhat constant for all countries and their respective languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Australia and the US, for example. Both countries speak English, but we often see differences in how we spell different words. Take the letter “Z”, for example. Most English-speaking countries, including Australia, the UK, New Zealand, etc., pronounce “Z” as ZED.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when it comes to countries like the US, the pronunciation of “Z” becomes ZEE. So while we spell “organisation” with an “S”, people in the US spell it as “organisation” with a “Z.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, you can’t transliterate such letters without knowing the country and its language. You can see why we keep saying that the answer to “</span>what is transliteration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?” is not always that simple.</span></p>\n<h3>Transliteration Is Possible Without Phonetic Conversion</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above, we saw the phonetic conversion process involved in transliteration. But does that mean phonetic conversion is an unavoidable aspect of transliteration? The answer is no because it is possible to have</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">without phonetic conversion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It begs the question, “</span>what does transliteration mean <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if a character in one language has an equivalent in another?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To answer this question, let’s take another example. Consider the German letter Ö.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the example we consider here is German, you can find the same letter in different German languages, including German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic. When you transliterate the letter Ö, you can get the result as O or OE. In this case, O and OE are considered equivalent to each other.</span></p>\n<h3>Transliteration And Romanisation Are Not The Same</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, people confuse transliteration with</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">romanisation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, you could say that romanisation is a form of transliteration. You may wonder</span> what is transliteration <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in romanisation and how it’s different from any other transliteration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two conditions for this type of transliteration. One – it must not use Roman characters, including the following.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arabic</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cyrillic</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Japanese</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Korean</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And two – the output language of romanisation must use Roman characters, such as</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">French</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">German</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanish</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Transliteration Include Converting Numbers</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People often don’t think about converting numbers when they research</span> what is transliteration<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But surprisingly enough, transliteration also includes converting numbers. Many languages, including Japanese, Korean, etc., have separate numbers, and transliteration can apply to such languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, transliteration can include converting Roman numerals to Japanese numbers. You can find the transliteration of five roman numbers to Japanese numbers in the table below. The good thing about transliterating numbers is that it rarely runs into complexities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, you can get accurate postal numbers, apartment numbers, etc., from an address, which can significantly help your business.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Roman Number</b></td>\n<td><b>Japanese Number</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I </span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">一</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">II</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">二</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">III</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">三</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IV</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">四</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">V</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">五</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading5\" style=\"text-align: left\">Transliteration vs Translation</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, you already know that</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are not the same. We even discussed the primary differences between the two. But does that mean that’s all the difference between the two processes?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, there is one other key difference we have not told you about yet. It might have come to your attention that translation is interchangeable. And if you did notice that, then you probably wondered the same about transliteration.</span></p>\n<h3>Transliteration Is Not Interchangeable</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The example of KONNICHIWA can better explain interchangeability in</span> transliteration and translation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you go ahead and type in “こんにちは” (KONNICHIWA) in Google Translate, the result would say “HELLO.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying out the reverse and typing in “HELLO” and translating it to Japanese, you will get “こんにちは” as the output. It is the simplest way to understand and ensure the interchangeability of translation. But what about transliteration?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the same logic, if you try to transliterate the word “HELLO,” you will likely get this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“ハロー”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The</span> translation vs transliteration <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argument gets interesting here. When you transliterate ハロー back to English, instead of getting HELLO, you get HARŌ. Transliteration is not a two-way process. And since interchangeability does not apply to it, there is a good chance of losing information.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height: 15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading6\" style=\"text-align: left\">Conclusion</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transliteration can benefit businesses across all spectrums regardless of which corner of the world they are in.

        "cleaned_post_text": "TABLE OF CONTENTSREQUEST A DEMOWhat Is Transliteration And Why You Need It For Effective Business Communication?The language barrier is one of the scariest things about opening your business to international customers. And if you have ever thought about expanding your customer base to international customers, you have also had similar insecurities. Perhaps, the part you are worried about the most is how you can read orverify addressesin another language.Translation is not the best option for business communication, considering the complexities of languages and the expense. It is why more and more businesses are now turning to transliteration for their business communication. But,what is transliteration? And why is it better suited for address verification?Below, we elaborate onwhat does transliteration meanand its best features. Furthermore, we also discuss the difference between translation and transliteration and explain why the latter could be a better choice for your business.What Is Transliteration?Transliteration is the process of converting text from one language to another. Although it sounds like translation,transliteration and translationare not the same. The primary difference between the two is the underlying meaning.When you translate a text or language, you still end up with meaningful words and sentences. In other words, you can maintain the underlying meaning in the original language in translation. But when it comes to transliteration, the underlying purpose is lost more often than not.As you can guess, there is a reason whytransliteration and translationare so different despite being so similar. Perhaps the underlying meaning is lost in transliteration because of the literal conversion of characters.In other words, transliteration switches a text or character from one language to another without bothering about the underlying meaning. Translation, as you know, is slightly more complex. But, we will discuss all the similarities and differences betweentransliteration and translationin the coming sections.What Does Transliteration Mean In Address Verification?Now that you have a clear idea ofwhat is transliterationlet’s look at its significance inaddress verification. As you can guess, transliteration (or translation for that matter) is only applicable when a business deals with international customers.Of course, it doesn’t apply to all international customers either. Perhaps, it is more apt to say thattransliteration and translationin address verification are applicable only when you deal with non-English speaking, global audiences.International Address DatabaseYou can benefit from transliteration if your business has a customer base that extends beyond English-speaking countries. In this case, you likely have your international customers’ addresses in their native language. You can already see whytransliteration and translationare essential here.The major challenge, of course, is to figure out the location of your customers using the address in Russian, Japanese, Arabic, etc. Imagine how much easier it would be for your business operations to spell the address in your native language.As you can imagine, bothtransliteration and translationtools can come in handy in such a situation. Of course, implementing the same is easier said than done, even if you are using relatively simple transliteration for address verification.CRM CompatibilityYou can’t just integrate an address verification solution into your business and hope it works. The essential thing you need to check is that your CRM software can support other languages. At the very least, you should ensure that your CRM can keep all the relevant languages.However, it would be best for you to ensure a CRM that can support additional languages. Doing so helps you with the potential customer base you wish to target in the future. On the other hand, if you already have an advanced CRM system, then implementingtransliteration and translationis relatively easy.A better CRM will allow you to enhance your business capabilities beyondtransliteration and translation. It allows you to runadvanceddirect mailcampaignsto send personalised communication/marketing materials to your international audiences.Address Parsing And Address StandardisationOne of the ways address verification tools like PostGrid can benefit your business is with its advanced address parsing and standardisation capability. Our system can break down your domestic and international addresses into small units and rearrange them into a standard format.As you can imagine, the process makestransliteration and translationof your addresses easier. A country’s official postal service provider decides the standard address format for sending postal mail within that country.For instance, the AusPost defines the standard address format for mailing in Australia. Similarly, USPS defines the standard address format in the US, Royal Mail in the UK, etc.Explaining What Is Transliteration With ExamplesThe best way to understandwhat is transliterationand how it can affect your business communication is through examples. And we don’t blame you if you are still unsure about the concept of transliteration because it is often confusing to everyone.But the good news is that we will help you clarify these confusions. We will help you understandwhat does transliterationmean for your business using simple examples. However, it might be a good idea to brush up on your Japanese because the word for the day is KONNICHIWA!For those of you who have no clue about the Japanese language, KONNICHIWA roughly translates to a greeting like “hello.” And if you were to translate KONNICHIWA to English, it would say hello or good morning. But anyway, we are here to talk about transliteration and not translation.Conversion In Transliteration“こんにちは”What may seem like random symbols you see above is KONNICHIWA in the native Japanese language. Now anytransliteration and translationprocess involves a conversion process. Although both approaches may seem similar, the results of the two methods can often be staggeringly different. The following table should help you understand the conversion process here.Japanese CharacterEquivalent Sound Of The CharacterこKOんNにNIちCHIはHA or WAAs we mentioned, transliteration merely gives you the character equivalent of the input language. Even though the conversion process is standard intransliteration and translation, the result here varies significantly.But before we explainwhat is the difference between a translation and a transliteration, let us consider the transliteration conversion. Everything goes smooth with transliterating KONNICHIWA from Japanese to English until you reach the last character は.But, here, things spice up a little in the conversion process because は has two sounds when you transliterate it. The two possible sounds of the character は are HA and WA.Different Phonetic Matches In TransliterationWe were talking about a single character (は) having different phonetic matches. It is evident from this example that transliteration also depends on the context. But does that meantransliteration and translationare more similar than we think?Even though the context matters here, there is no way of knowing which. But, to help yourself understand the concept better, think of は like the letter C in “cold” and “city.” As you can see, even though you are using the same letter or character, the sound can be entirely different.Transliteration Can Vary With The CountryEven if the official language of the two countries is the same, it is not necessary to have the exact transliteration for the characters. It is another noteworthy difference betweentransliteration and translation.Translation remains somewhat constant for all countries and their respective languages.Take Australia and the US, for example. Both countries speak English, but we often see differences in how we spell different words. Take the letter “Z”, for example. Most English-speaking countries, including Australia, the UK, New Zealand, etc., pronounce “Z” as ZED.But when it comes to countries like the US, the pronunciation of “Z” becomes ZEE. So while we spell “organisation” with an “S”, people in the US spell it as “organisation” with a “Z.”In other words, you can’t transliterate such letters without knowing the country and its language. You can see why we keep saying that the answer to “what is transliteration?” is not always that simple.Transliteration Is Possible Without Phonetic ConversionAbove, we saw the phonetic conversion process involved in transliteration. But does that mean phonetic conversion is an unavoidable aspect of transliteration? The answer is no because it is possible to havetransliteration and translationwithout phonetic conversion.It begs the question, “what does transliteration meanif a character in one language has an equivalent in another?”To answer this question, let’s take another example. Consider the German letter Ö.Even though the example we consider here is German, you can find the same letter in different German languages, including German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic. When you transliterate the letter Ö, you can get the result as O or OE. In this case, O and OE are considered equivalent to each other.Transliteration And Romanisation Are Not The SameOften, people confuse transliteration withromanisation. However, you could say that romanisation is a form of transliteration. You may wonderwhat is transliterationin romanisation and how it’s different from any other transliteration.There are two conditions for this type of transliteration. One – it must not use Roman characters, including the following.ArabicChineseCyrillicJapaneseKoreanAnd more.And two – the output language of romanisation must use Roman characters, such asEnglishFrenchGermanSpanishTransliteration Include Converting NumbersPeople often don’t think about converting numbers when they researchwhat is transliteration. But surprisingly enough, transliteration also includes converting numbers. Many languages, including Japanese, Korean, etc., have separate numbers, and transliteration can apply to such languages.For instance, transliteration can include converting Roman numerals to Japanese numbers. You can find the transliteration of five roman numbers to Japanese numbers in the table below. The good thing about transliterating numbers is that it rarely runs into complexities.As a result, you can get accurate postal numbers, apartment numbers, etc., from an address, which can significantly help your business.Roman NumberJapanese NumberI一II二III三IV四V五Transliteration vs TranslationAt this point, you already know thattransliteration and translationare not the same. We even discussed the primary differences between the two. But does that mean that’s all the difference between the two processes?No, there is one other key difference we have not told you about yet. It might have come to your attention that translation is interchangeable. And if you did notice that, then you probably wondered the same about transliteration.Transliteration Is Not InterchangeableThe example of KONNICHIWA can better explain interchangeability intransliteration and translation. If you go ahead and type in “こんにちは” (KONNICHIWA) in Google Translate, the result would say “HELLO.”Trying out the reverse and typing in “HELLO” and translating it to Japanese, you will get “こんにちは” as the output. It is the simplest way to understand and ensure the interchangeability of translation. But what about transliteration?Using the same logic, if you try to transliterate the word “HELLO,” you will likely get this.“ハロー”Thetranslation vs transliterationargument gets interesting here. When you transliterate ハロー back to English, instead of getting HELLO, you get HARŌ. Transliteration is not a two-way process. And since interchangeability does not apply to it, there is a good chance of losing information.ConclusionTransliteration can benefit businesses across all spectrums regardless of which corner of the world they are in. It is an effective tool that can help you analyse and assess the address information of your contacts without knowing the language.However, many businesses are still aware of transliteration. And most thinktransliteration and translationare the same. It is vital to differentiate between the two processes and use them effectively for business communication.Furthermore, business organisations need advancedaddress verification servicetools like PostGrid to streamline communication.
