I'm updating passwords!I'm always one step ahead....So... I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence.The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.I posted EternalBlue Exploit modification on porn site, and then you installed my malicious code (trojan) on your operation system.When you clicked the button Play on porn video, at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device.After installation, your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate, in addition, the software is synchronized with the video you choose.For the moment, the software has harvrested all your contact information from social networks and email addresses.If you need to erase all of your collected data and videos, send me $776 in BTC (crypto currency).This is my Bitcoin wallet: 158r99HsERpiBqWg3w2FCPHbUfkXG8ZxsdYou have 48 hours after reading this letter.After your transaction I will erase all your data.Otherwise, I will send a video with your sweepstakes to all your colleagues, friends and relatives!!!P.S. I ask you not to reply to this email, this is impossible (the sender's address is your own address).And henceforth be more careful!Please visit only secure sites!Bye,Bye...",
