        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!   I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 18JafCUSR3JWJuxbSH9Wp4AUizzTwkZz9D   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\nGreetings!    I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).   Here is my Bitcoin address: 18bSTrufLfuvHwS7JYuF626MBGULSmxTgR    I really want to settle this situation in a peaceful manner and I believe you want that too.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!    I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).   Here is my Bitcoin address: 18bSTrufLfuvHwS7JYuF626MBGULSmxTgR    I really want to settle this situation in a peaceful manner and I believe you want that too.    Nothing personal, it is simply my job.   Make sure you use valid Antivirus software and stay away from unwanted websites.  Take care of yourself.",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 12nEVuGNtRFMVjeVmLtD4nt2sHX68S47yH   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",
