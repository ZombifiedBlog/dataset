I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!</div></div></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit. \r<br/>Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you.\r<br/> <br/>With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.\r<br/>That merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that. \r<br/>Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours.\r<br/> <br/>You may be wondering, \"However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts?\" \r<br/>To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis, \r<br/>which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.\r<br/> <br/>I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/>Still puzzled how much damage could that cause?

Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit.Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you.With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.That merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that.Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours.You may be wondering, \"However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts?\"To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis,which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.Still puzzled how much damage could that cause? One mouse click is enough for me to share this video to your social networks, as well as e-mail contacts of yours.In addition, I am also able to gain access to all e-mail correspondence as well as messengers used by you.Below are simple steps required for you to undertake in order to avoid that from occurring - transfer $1350 in Bitcoin equivalent to my wallet(if you don't know how to complete that, just open your browser and make a google search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin wallet address (BTC Wallet) is: 14dbcD3gXf5eHkYuA2PYf2nakQ5B7hVqHjOnce the payment has been confirmed, I shall remove the video without delay, and that is end of story - afterwards you won't hear about me again for sure.The time for you to perform the transaction is 2 days (48 hours).After this e-mail is opened by you, I will get an automatic notice, which will start my timer.Any effort to complain will not change anything at all, because this e-mail is simply untraceable, just like my bitcoin address.I have been developing these plans for quite an extended period of time; so, don't expect any mistake from my side.If, get to know that you tried to send this message to anyone else, I will distribute your video as described earlier.",

I have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website.<br/>  This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that I have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and that’s why this type of an attack can go undetected.<br/>  You only need one not patched vulnerability to be infected, and unfortunately for you – it works that simple.<br/><br/>  You were not targeted specifically, but just became one of the quite a few unlucky people who got hacked that day.<br/>  All of this happened a few month ago. So I’ve had time to collect information on you.<br/><br/>  I think you already know what is going to happen next.<br/>  During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.<br/>  There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.<br/><br/>  For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.<br/>  It was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated.<br/><br/>  I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.<br/>  So here is my offer. I need a consulting fee to delete the media content I have been collecting.<br/>  Your privacy stays untouched, if I get paid.<br/>  Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore.<br/><br/>  I understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.<br/>  Please dont blame me – we all have different ways of making a living.<br/><br/>  I have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if I get paid.<br/>  I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.<br/>  I only care about getting paid.<br/><br/>  My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin.

So I’ve had time to collect information on you.I think you already know what is going to happen next.During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.It was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated.I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.So here is my offer. I need a consulting fee to delete the media content I have been collecting.Your privacy stays untouched, if I get paid.Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore.I understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.Please dont blame me – we all have different ways of making a living.I have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if I get paid.I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.I only care about getting paid.My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 17U1BaXwyuxeX2sZyMjC25G8skrZ8mtTdzThe fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.We use Bitcoin to protect my identity.Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.Take care.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi. You will find this important.You have used Zoom some time ago. And I have very unfortunate news for you.I'll give you some background on what happened.There was a zero day security vulnerability on Zoom app, that allowed me a full time access to your camera and some other metadata on your account.I had access to your camera ALL the time, even when Zoom app was closed. Basically, your device was hacked and remotely controlled.And as you can imagine in your worst dreams, I have made a footage with you as a leading actor.In the video you can be seen performing sexual act.Having fun is ok with me, but is not ok with your reputation.Please dont blame me or yourself for this. You couldn't know that the camera was working.I'm sure you don't want to be the next Jeffrey Toobin and get embarrassed in front of all your friends, family and colleagues.You should get this very clear, I will send this video to all your contacts if I dont get paid.Are you wondering how I got your contacts and emails? Through the same exploit, zoom app allowed me to extract all sensitive info from your device.So here is what we will do. You pay me $2000 in bitcoin, and nothing of this will happen. You have 2 days to make the payment.After I get the money, I will delete the footage and information about you. The amount is not negotiable.Send 0.13 Bitcoin (less than 2k USD at the current exchange rate) to my wallet 1KJ3ZrhrkXBVjGyAU635sapjLpLSFgpqYeHaving trouble with buying bitcoin?
