I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.

In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.

I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).

I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1ND3JTwUaYWhDjTuaAK8idmpmuRQGqAkB1You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hello!Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant news for you.Roughly several months ago I have managed to get a complete access to all devices that you use to browse internet.Afterwards, I have proceeded with monitoring all internet activities of yours.You can check out the sequence of events summarize below:Previously I have bought from hackers a special access to various email accounts (currently, it is rather a straightforward thing that can be done online).Clearly, I could effortlessly log in to your email account as well (carmencorcoz.eventscorcoz@blogger.com).One week after that, I proceeded with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all your devices, which are used by you to login to your email.Actually, that was rather a simple thing to do (because you have opened a few links from your inbox emails previously).Genius is in simplicity. ( ~_^)Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.We can still resolve it in the following manner:You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1MW4maqRuqi62YiRNMaBiHT65WJJMEAvQwYou are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay.> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have to share bad news with you.Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Here is the sequence of events:Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (carmencorcoz.eventscorcoz@blogger.com).One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).All ingenious is simple. =)This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.Let's settle it this way:You transfer $1650 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1LKWDMofCWVgDSUH3Qoui6LxJ2VSUtsDCEYou have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!Everything will be done in a fair manner!One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis",
