I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.

Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.

You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).

(&gt;_&lt;)\r<br/> <br/>The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.\r<br/>I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.\r<br/>I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.\r<br/>My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.\r<br/> <br/>So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...\r<br/> <br/>While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.\r<br/>You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.\r<br/>I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.\r<br/> <br/>If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.\r<br/>It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.\r<br/>I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.\r<br/> <br/>Let's resolve it like this:\r<br/>All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.\r<br/>Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.\r<br/> <br/>That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.\r<br/>If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 12gHyoR78pjHpfueWUYyMudnwNMc6NGEPY\r<br/> <br/>You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).\r<br/> <br/>Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately. \r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (amarofernandez.regional@blogger.com).Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).Yeah, geniuses are among us.Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1r8KDQsoFUWLdV1D2L1vc66YibNDrrYysAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit. \r<br/>Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you.\r<br/> <br/>With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.\r<br/>That merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that. \r<br/>Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours.\r<br/> <br/>You may be wondering, \"However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts?\" \r<br/>To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis, \r<br/>which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.\r<br/> <br/>I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/>Still puzzled how much damage could that cause?

Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1500 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it’s not very difficult.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 13dk8JbVeEKGmHq7aevbdVxjg2cHYFT4kgYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.
