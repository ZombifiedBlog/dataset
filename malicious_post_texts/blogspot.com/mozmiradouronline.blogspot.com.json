I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1270 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Transfer $1350 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 12aJgkbT9o zAZnVwiKDg76 FNpS6FcCeVvS  Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.   An important notice: I have specified my Bitcoin wallet with spaces, hence once you carry out a transfer,   please make sure that you key-in my bitcoin address without spaces to be sure that your funds successfully reach my wallet!   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!</span></font></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

Furthermore, I guarantee that all the malicious software will also be erased from your devices and accounts. \r<br/>Mark my words, I never lie.\r<br/> <br/>That is a great bargain with a low price, I assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recording \r<br/>and tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.\r<br/>In case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 1LrBGezKti4m2cov7CKuurLnCfQvjp2o1A\r<br/> <br/>From now on, you have only 48 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>The following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:\r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services. In addition, it's a bad idea if you want to share it with your friends, \r<br/> hoping they would help. If I happen to find out (knowing my awesome skills, it can be done effortlessly,\r<br/> because I have all your devices and accounts under my control and unceasing observation) - kinky videos of yours will be share to public the same day. \r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to look for me - that would not lead anywhere either. Cryptocurrency transactions are absolutely anonymous and cannot be tracked.\r<br/>&gt; Abstain from reinstalling your OS on devices or throwing them away.

Furthermore, I guarantee that all the malicious software will also be erased from your devices and accounts.Mark my words, I never lie.That is a great bargain with a low price, I assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recordingand tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.In case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.Here is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 1LrBGezKti4m2cov7CKuurLnCfQvjp2o1AFrom now on, you have only 48 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, 2 days).The following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:> Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).> Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services. In addition, it's a bad idea if you want to share it with your friends,hoping they would help. If I happen to find out (knowing my awesome skills, it can be done effortlessly,because I have all your devices and accounts under my control and unceasing observation) - kinky videos of yours will be share to public the same day.> Abstain from trying to look for me - that would not lead anywhere either. Cryptocurrency transactions are absolutely anonymous and cannot be tracked.> Abstain from reinstalling your OS on devices or throwing them away. That would not solve the problem as well,since all your personal videos are already uploaded and stored at remote servers.Things you may be confused about:> That your funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Chill, I can track down any transactions right away, so upon funds transfer I will receive a notification as well,since I still control your devices (my trojan virus has ability of controlling all processes remotely, just like TeamViewer).> That I am going to share your dirty videos after receiving money transfer from you.Here you need to trust me, because there is absolutely no point to still bother you after receiving money.Moreover, if I really wanted all those videos would be available to public long time ago!I believe we can still handle this situation on fair terms!Here is my last advice to you... in future you better ensure you stay away from this kind of situations!My advice - don't forget to regularly update your passwords to feel completely secure.",

Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-1880230649427813354\" itemprop=\"description articleBody\">\nHey! \r<br/> <br/>As you can see, this is not a formal email, and unfortunately, it does not mean anything good for you. \r<br/>BUT do not despair, it is not critical. I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen.

We write to notify you of a data security incident that may have exposed some of your personal information. This notice explains the incident and steps ShareThis has undertaken to address it. In addition, we provide guidance below on what you can do to protect your personal information.<br/>   <br/> <strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>  On February 11, 2019, ShareThis became aware that it suffered a data security incident when it was informed that <em>The Register </em>published a story indicating that 16 companies, including ShareThis, were the victims of a data theft. We can tell from our initial investigations that email addresses, hashed passwords and some birth dates were impacted.  The incident, unfortunately, only came to light when <em>The Register</em> reported that the hacker posted the data for sale on the dark web.<br/>   <br/> <strong>What Information Was Involved?</strong><br/>  Although our investigation is ongoing, we believe that the incident occurred in July 2018 and your name, email and hashed password may have been acquired by an unauthorized person or persons. Please note that we have no indication that your password has been used by the hacker or other unauthorized individual. As a result, your personal data may have been compromised.  <br/>   <br/> <strong>What We Are Doing.</strong><br/>  We value your privacy and deeply regret that this incident occurred.  ShareThis will be deactivating any ShareThis accounts associated with this email address.  We are reviewing our internal systems and are in the process of working with forensic and data security experts to review this incident and to identify any additional measures we can take to further bolster our security.   <br/>   <br/> <strong>What You Can Do.</strong><br/>  We want to make sure that you have resources to protect your personal information.  As noted above, we deactivated the ShareThis account associated with this email address, so no one will be able to log into it.  However, we recommend that you change your password for any other accounts for which you use the same or similar email address or password and take other appropriate steps to protect your online accounts.  We also encourage you to be cautious of spam or other phishing emails, including those that solicit personal data. You can also review the <strong>Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Personal Information</strong> below.<br/>   <br/> <strong>Other Important Information.</strong><br/>  Maintaining the integrity of confidential information is extremely important to us.
