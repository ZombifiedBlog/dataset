I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

You have nothing to worry about,\r<br/>because I keep my word at all times.\r<br/> <br/>That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\r<br/>taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\r<br/>If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9C\r<br/> <br/>All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\r<br/>&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\r<br/>&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\r<br/> If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - \r<br/> your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away. \r<br/>&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (nickolashays23.kidsplayroom83@blogger.com).Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).Yeah, geniuses are among us.Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:You make a transaction of $1370 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1P5vLEEuGawo33WLs3pVdxTuyjqt7Ymf9CAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

That would not solve the problem as well,since all your personal videos are already uploaded and stored at remote servers.Things you may be confused about:> That your funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Chill, I can track down any transactions right away, so upon funds transfer I will receive a notification as well,since I still control your devices (my trojan virus has ability of controlling all processes remotely, just like TeamViewer).> That I am going to share your dirty videos after receiving money transfer from you.Here you need to trust me, because there is absolutely no point to still bother you after receiving money.Moreover, if I really wanted all those videos would be available to public long time ago!I believe we can still handle this situation on fair terms!Here is my last advice to you... in future you better ensure you stay away from this kind of situations!My advice - don't forget to regularly update your passwords to feel completely secure.",

With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have to share bad news with you.Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Here is the sequence of events:Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (nickolashays23.kidsplayroom83@blogger.com).One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).All ingenious is simple. =)This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.Let's settle it this way:You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1xPr18gM8YKsaiUkGz9MgpjtwcBQcME2iYou have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!Everything will be done in a fair manner!One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis",

But my malware intercepts it every time.How I made it:In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!I'm talk you about sites for adults.I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!And I got an idea....I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.I think $632 is a very, very small amount for my silence.Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!My BTC wallet: 145SmyE7DBEQExsnXZobojbQqr5UdgbCHhYou do not know how to use bitcoins?Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".It's extremely easyFor this payment I give you two days (48 hours).As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".I hope you understand your situation.- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server.P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment!This is the word of honor hackerI also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation.Do not hold evil! I just do my job.Have a nice day!",
