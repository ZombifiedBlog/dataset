I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit.I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times.I know what you like hard funs (adult sites).Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone.Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :)I took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera.Believe it turned out very high quality!So, to the business!I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts.Transfer $1340 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 14YLQ A98RN JX22W2 Prmc7PR QNf6QQ f1B1DJust copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.An important notice: I have specified my Bitcoin wallet with spaces, hence once you carry out a transfer,please make sure that you key-in my bitcoin address without spaces to be sure that your funds successfully reach my wallet!If you do not know how to do this - ask Google.My system automatically recognizes the translation.As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system.Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position.You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it.Since opening this letter you have 48 hours.If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted,and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material.P.S. Do not try to contact me (this is impossible, sender's address was randomly generated).I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server).Good luck!",

Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited.

In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.\r<br/> <br/>I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.\r<br/>Wondering how bad could this get?

You are so spectacular!I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.I think $739 is a very, very small amount for my silence.Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!My BTC wallet: 1CtE3LcQDy2vB5Y2r4RZxUnExCLarmu7aRYou do not know how to use bitcoins?Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".It's extremely easyFor this payment I give you two days (48 hours).As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".I hope you understand your situation.- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)- Do not try to contact me (you yourself will see that this is impossible, I sent you an email from your account)- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server.P.S.
