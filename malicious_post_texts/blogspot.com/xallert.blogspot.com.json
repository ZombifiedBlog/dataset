I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 18JafCUSR3JWJuxbSH9Wp4AUizzTwkZz9D   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit.I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times.I know what you like hard funs (adult sites).Oh, yes ..

You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).

(>_<)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 12gHyoR78pjHpfueWUYyMudnwNMc6NGEPYYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1r8KDQsoFUWLdV1D2L1vc66YibNDrrYysAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

Qualche mese fa sono riuscito ad avere accesso completo a tutti i dispositivi che usi per navigare in rete.  Ciò mi ha permesso di monitorare tutte le tue attività su Internet.   Ecco, in sintesi, la sequenza degli eventi:  innanzitutto, ho acquistato dagli hacker un accesso speciale a vari account e-mail (oggigiorno è un’operazione abbastanza semplice da fare online).  Chiaramente, sono riuscito ad entrare tranquillamente anche nel tuo account (ebookonomy.mrnews@blogger.com).   La settimana successiva ho installato un virus Trojan nei sistemi operativi di tutti i dispositivi che utilizzi per accedere alla tua posta elettronica.  In realtà, è stato abbastanza semplice (perché in passato hai aperto alcuni link dai tuoi messaggi).   Semplice e geniale.   Grazie a quel software posso avere accesso a tutti i controller all’interno dei tuoi dispositivi (come la videocamera, il microfono, la tastiera, ecc.)   Sono riuscito tranquillamente a scaricare tutti i tuoi dati, le tue foto, la cronologia di navigazione e altre informazioni nei miei server.  Posso accedere ai tuoi account social, ai messaggi, alle e-mail, oltre che alla cronologia della tua chat e alla rubrica.   Il mio virus aggiorna costantemente le firme (poiché è controllato da un driver) e pertanto non viene rilevato dal software antivirus.    A questo punto credo che ormai sia chiaro il motivo per cui non sono stato mai scoperto fino al momento in cui ho inviato questa lettera...   Esaminando tutte le informazioni che ti riguardano ho scoperto anche che sei un vero appassionato e frequentatore abituale dei siti per adulti.  Ti piace davvero sfogliare i siti porno per guardare i video eccitanti e provare una soddisfazione inimmaginabile.  Onestamente, non ho potuto resistere alla tentazione di registrare alcune delle tue sessioni perverse di autoerotismo e le ho raccolte in svariati video,   che ti immortalano mentre ti masturbi e alla fine raggiungi l’orgasmo.    Se non ti fidi ancora di me, sappi che mi bastano pochi clic del mouse per condividere tutti quei video con i tuoi colleghi, amici e perfino parenti.  Inoltre, posso caricarli online e renderli pubblici.  Sono sicurissimo che tu non voglia assolutamente che accada ciò, tenendo presente che tutta la roba perversa mostrata in quei video che guardi abitualmente   (hai sicuramente capito di che cosa sto parlando) potrebbe avere conseguenze disastrose per te.   Possiamo risolvere la questione nel seguente modo:  Effettui un trasferimento di 1550 EUR sul mio conto   (equivalente in bitcoin in base al tasso di cambio al momento del trasferimento dei fondi) e subito dopo cancellerò definitivamente tutti quei video scandalosi senza esitazione.  Così possiamo far finta che non sia successo mai niente. Inoltre, ti garantisco che tutto il software dannoso sarà disattivato e rimosso dai tuoi dispositivi.   Non preoccuparti, sono un uomo di parola.   È davvero un buon accordo a un prezzo notevolmente basso, tenendo presente che ho monitorato il tuo profilo, oltre che le tue attività in rete, per un lungo periodo di tempo.  Se non hai ancora familiarità con le procedure di acquisto e trasferimento dei bitcoin, non devi fare altro che trovare tutte le informazioni necessarie online.   Il mio portafoglio bitcoin è il seguente: 1M4bujoHX8TVpWw65zxNHKeDTHZXouZcpR   Ti restano 48 ore (2 giorni per essere più specifici) e il conto alla rovescia inizia subito dopo aver aperto questa e-mail.   Evita assolutamente di fare le seguenti mosse:  &gt; Non cercare di rispondere alla mia e-mail (è stata generata nella tua casella di posta insieme all’indirizzo del mittente).  &gt; Non cercare di chiamare la polizia o altri servizi di sicurezza. Inoltre, non ci pensare neanche a condividere l’accaduto con i tuoi amici.    Se lo scopro (date le mie competenze sarebbe semplicissimo dal momento che controllo e monitoro costantemente i tuoi sistemi),    tutti i tuoi video indecenti diventeranno rapidamente di dominio pubblico.   &gt; Non cercare di rintracciarmi – è del tutto inutile. Le transazioni in criptovaluta restano sempre anonime.  &gt; Non cercare di reinstallare il sistema operativo sui tuoi dispostivi o addirittura di sbarazzarti di questi ultimi.   Non avrebbe senso dal momento che tutti i tuoi video privati sono memorizzati su server remoti.   Cose di cui non dovresti preoccuparti:  &gt; Che io non riceva i fondi dopo il tuo trasferimento.   Rilassati, riuscirò a tracciarlo immediatamente, subito dopo che avrai completato la transazione, perché monitoro costantemente le tue attività    (il mio virus trojan riesce a controllare da remoto tutte le operazioni, proprio come TeamViewer).  &gt; Che condivida i tuoi video dopo che mi avrai inviato i soldi.   Credimi, per me sarebbe inutile continuare a tormentarti. Tra l’altro, se fosse stata davvero mia intenzione, sarebbe successo molto tempo fa!    Si sistemerà tutto in termini equi!

Ho cattive notizie per te.  Due mesi fa ho ottenuto l’accesso ai dispositivi che usi per navigare in rete. Da quel momento ho cominciato a monitorare tutta la tua attività sul web.    Ora ti rivelerò com’è successo:  Ho creato un sito web falso del tuo servizio e-mail (domain.com) e ti ho inviato una richiesta di autorizzazione.  Tu hai inserito il tuo indirizzo e-mail e la tua password corrente.   Ecco come ho avuto le tue credenziali d’accesso e ho cominciato a usare la tua e-mail senza che te ne accorgessi.  Dopodiché sono riuscito a installare facilmente un Trojan horse nel sistema operativo del tuo dispositivo.  (L’hai fatto tu stesso, una volta che hai aperto il file in uno dei messaggi di phishing che ho creato nella tua e-mail).  Il virus mi fornisce l’accesso a tutti i controller del tuo dispositivo (videocamera, microfono, tastiera ecc.).  Allo stesso modo, ho salvato i dati, le foto, i video, i dati di accesso alle social network, le chat e i contatti.   Questo software dannoso è aggiornato regolarmente, pertanto è quasi impossibile rilevarlo da parte di vari servizi e amministratori di sistema.   Ecco perché mi sono reso completamente invisibile per te per molto tempo.  Ultimamente ho scoperto che sei un grande fan del porno e che ti piace guardare i “video XXX”.   Credo che tu sappia che cosa intendo dire...sono riuscito a editare alcune clip, in cui raggiungi l’orgasmo con gusto e ho incluso i film che stavi guardando mentre ti masturbavi.  Stai pur certo che posso inviare questo video interessante a tutti i tuoi contatti, amici e parenti o semplicemente pubblicarlo in rete con un semplice clic del mouse,   non credo che ti piacerebbe che succedesse. Sarebbe una vera vergogna e tragedia per te.   Bene, non voglio metterti in una situazione del genere, poiché vedo che sei una persona onesta e rispettabile.   Pertanto, ti propongo un accordo:  Mi invii 950 EUR in Bitcoin e dopo aver ricevuto il pagamento, cancellerò immediatamente tutte le prove contro di te.   Sto lavorando su di te e sui tuoi file da un paio di mesi, ormai, e credimi, queste sono solo briciole per me!  Se non sai come acquistare e inviare Bitcoin, puoi semplicemente usare qualsiasi motore di ricerca (Google è perfetto) per farti aiutare.    Allora, ecco il mio Bitcoin wallet: 165qc1P4Zg9u4bGzvBsGR1jEEGxTPDnHeA    Ti do 48 di tempo per inviarmi il denaro.  Non rispondere alla mia e-mail, poiché è inutile. Ho creato questa lettera nella tua e-mail e l’indirizzo che ho ottenuto da un singolo database di indirizzi.   Non ha senso neanche chiedere aiuto a qualcuno, perché questa mail non può essere ricondotta a me e le transazioni Bitcoin sono sempre anonime.   È stato tutto pianificato attentamente.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Ciao!   Ho cattive notizie per te.  Due mesi fa ho ottenuto l’accesso ai dispositivi che usi per navigare in rete. Da quel momento ho cominciato a monitorare tutta la tua attività sul web.    Ora ti rivelerò com’è successo:  Ho creato un sito web falso del tuo servizio e-mail (domain.com) e ti ho inviato una richiesta di autorizzazione.  Tu hai inserito il tuo indirizzo e-mail e la tua password corrente.   Ecco come ho avuto le tue credenziali d’accesso e ho cominciato a usare la tua e-mail senza che te ne accorgessi.  Dopodiché sono riuscito a installare facilmente un Trojan horse nel sistema operativo del tuo dispositivo.  (L’hai fatto tu stesso, una volta che hai aperto il file in uno dei messaggi di phishing che ho creato nella tua e-mail).  Il virus mi fornisce l’accesso a tutti i controller del tuo dispositivo (videocamera, microfono, tastiera ecc.).  Allo stesso modo, ho salvato i dati, le foto, i video, i dati di accesso alle social network, le chat e i contatti.   Questo software dannoso è aggiornato regolarmente, pertanto è quasi impossibile rilevarlo da parte di vari servizi e amministratori di sistema.   Ecco perché mi sono reso completamente invisibile per te per molto tempo.  Ultimamente ho scoperto che sei un grande fan del porno e che ti piace guardare i “video XXX”.   Credo che tu sappia che cosa intendo dire...sono riuscito a editare alcune clip, in cui raggiungi l’orgasmo con gusto e ho incluso i film che stavi guardando mentre ti masturbavi.  Stai pur certo che posso inviare questo video interessante a tutti i tuoi contatti, amici e parenti o semplicemente pubblicarlo in rete con un semplice clic del mouse,   non credo che ti piacerebbe che succedesse. Sarebbe una vera vergogna e tragedia per te.   Bene, non voglio metterti in una situazione del genere, poiché vedo che sei una persona onesta e rispettabile.   Pertanto, ti propongo un accordo:  Mi invii 950 EUR in Bitcoin e dopo aver ricevuto il pagamento, cancellerò immediatamente tutte le prove contro di te.   Sto lavorando su di te e sui tuoi file da un paio di mesi, ormai, e credimi, queste sono solo briciole per me!  Se non sai come acquistare e inviare Bitcoin, puoi semplicemente usare qualsiasi motore di ricerca (Google è perfetto) per farti aiutare.    Allora, ecco il mio Bitcoin wallet: 165qc1P4Zg9u4bGzvBsGR1jEEGxTPDnHeA    Ti do 48 di tempo per inviarmi il denaro.  Non rispondere alla mia e-mail, poiché è inutile. Ho creato questa lettera nella tua e-mail e l’indirizzo che ho ottenuto da un singolo database di indirizzi.   Non ha senso neanche chiedere aiuto a qualcuno, perché questa mail non può essere ricondotta a me e le transazioni Bitcoin sono sempre anonime.   È stato tutto pianificato attentamente.  Vedo tutte le tue chat, intercetto le tue chiamate e ti spio.   Pertanto, nel caso in cui scoprissi che hai parlato con qualcuno di questa lettera, il video sarà condiviso immediatamente in rete!  Non appena aprirai questa lettera, riceverò una notifica automatica e farò partire il conto alla rovescia.   Buona fortuna e ti auguro di non ricevere mai più un messaggio di phishing come questo in futuro!",

Yeah, you are one of them. Not everyone chooses to watch such hardcore videos...\r<br/>Basically, I have infected your device with one of the best Trojan viruses in the market. It was relatively easy, since I have access to your email address (<a href=\"mailto:ebookonomy.mrnews@blogger.com\">ebookonomy.mrnews@blogger.com</a>).\r<br/>It was sufficient to prepare one of your routine emails asking you to click the harmful link...\r<br/> <br/>My spyware functions as a driver. Hence, I can fully control your device and have access to your microphone, camera, cursor and set of symbols.\r<br/>Generally speaking, your device is some sort of my remote PC.\r<br/>Since this spyware is driver-based, then I can constantly update its signatures, so that no antivirus can detect it.\r<br/>While digging through your hard drive, I have saved your entire contact list, social media access, chat history and media files.\r<br/> <br/>One week ago, I have montaged a videoclip, which shows you masturbating on one side of the screen and on the other side a porn video \r<br/>that you were watching at that moment of time - recently this type of exotic stuff is really popular on the internet!\r<br/>Don't worry, I will need just a few mouse clicks in order to share this video with your entire contact list and upload it to some porn website, like Bigle.\r<br/>I believe that you would not like this to happen, since a long holiday season is just about to start soon - \r<br/>just imagine the number of silly jokes and loud laughter that would get provoked by your video all over the neighbourhood bars and pubs...\r<br/> <br/>I am offering a simple and reasonable solution:\r<br/>All you need to do is transfer an amount equivalent to $1450 (USA Dollars) to my bitcoin wallet and we both forget about this silly story forever.\r<br/>All your data and this video will be deleted by me once and for all. You have my honest word!\r<br/>You've got to agree, this amount is really insignificant.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have got two not really pleasant news for you.I have been monitoring your internet activities for some time by now.The only person to blame in this situation is you, since you are a big fan of adult websites and also have got an uncontrollable desire to indulge yourself with another orgasm.Simply speaking, all your porn websites search requests have become a key to access your device.The thing is that I word in a company that provides services related to security and performance of email providers, includingblogger.comas well.During the pandemic outbreak a lot of providers have faced difficulties in maintaining a huge number of staff in their offices and so they have decided to use outsourcing instead.While working remotely from home, I have got unlimited abilities to access the user databases.I can easily decrypt passwords of users, access their chat history and online traffic with help of cookie-files.I have decided to analyse users traffic related to adult websites and adult content.I was truly shocked to discover that nearly 75% of users regularly access porn websites or participates in sex chats.I have filtered out the worst perverts from the list. Yeah, you are one of them. Not everyone chooses to watch such hardcore videos...Basically, I have infected your device with one of the best Trojan viruses in the market. It was relatively easy, since I have access to your email address (ebookonomy.mrnews@blogger.com).It was sufficient to prepare one of your routine emails asking you to click the harmful link...My spyware functions as a driver. Hence, I can fully control your device and have access to your microphone, camera, cursor and set of symbols.Generally speaking, your device is some sort of my remote PC.Since this spyware is driver-based, then I can constantly update its signatures, so that no antivirus can detect it.While digging through your hard drive, I have saved your entire contact list, social media access, chat history and media files.One week ago, I have montaged a videoclip, which shows you masturbating on one side of the screen and on the other side a porn videothat you were watching at that moment of time - recently this type of exotic stuff is really popular on the internet!Don't worry, I will need just a few mouse clicks in order to share this video with your entire contact list and upload it to some porn website, like Bigle.I believe that you would not like this to happen, since a long holiday season is just about to start soon -just imagine the number of silly jokes and loud laughter that would get provoked by your video all over the neighbourhood bars and pubs...I am offering a simple and reasonable solution:All you need to do is transfer an amount equivalent to $1450 (USA Dollars) to my bitcoin wallet and we both forget about this silly story forever.All your data and this video will be deleted by me once and for all. You have my honest word!You've got to agree, this amount is really insignificant. Just imagine how much time and resources I have spent to get this done...If you don't know how to operate the cryptocurrency - you can always search for assistance online. It is that simple.Here is my bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1LsTK4bKaUGMXgbqo4n3Vc7quu6UvATjfzYou have exactly 2 days (48 hours) from the moment of opening this email.I can easily track when you have opened this email (my software will notify me about it). Once you complete the transaction - I will be able to see and confirm that.Please, do not try replying me via this email - there is no point in that (I have generated the header of this email as well as return address).Remember that there is no point to complain anywhere, since I cannot be found (Bitcoin system is anonymous and I am also using I2P network in order to access your device).I have considered all the small details.In case, if 48 hours after you have opened this email,I still don't receive the required amount of money, then your videoclip will be automatically sent to all your contact list and uploaded to public websites.Good luck and please don't hate me too much!This is life!

Hai notato che ti ho inviato un’e-mail dal tuo account?  Sì, ciò significa semplicemente che ho l’accesso completo al tuo dispositivo.   È da un paio di mesi che ti tengo d’occhio.  Ti stai chiedendo come? Sei stato infettato da un malware mentre visitavi un sito web per adulti.   Forse non sai di che cosa sto parlando, ma cercherò di spiegartelo.  Attraverso il Trojan Virus, ho l’accesso completo a un PC o a qualsiasi altro dispositivo.  Ciò significa che posso controllarti in qualsiasi momento sul tuo schermo accendendo la tua telecamera e il tuo microfono, senza nemmeno che te ne accorga.  Inoltre, ho accesso all’elenco dei tuoi contatti e alla tua corrispondenza.   Forse ti starai chiedendo, “Ma sul mio PC è attivato l’antivirus, com’è possibile? Perché non ho ricevuto una notifica?”   Bene, la risposta è semplice; il mio malware usa i driver e aggiorno le firme ogni quattro ore, rendendolo non rilevabile e disattivando il tuo antivirus.   Ho un filmato di te mentre ti seghi sulla sinistra della schermo e il video che stavi guardando mentre ti masturbavi sulla destra dello schermo.  Vuoi sapere come potrebbe andare peggio? Con un semplice clic del mouse possono inviare questo video a tutti i tuoi social network e contatti e-mail.  Posso anche postare l’accesso in tutta la corrispondenza e nei messaggi e-mail.   Per evitare che tutto questo accada devi semplicemente trasferire bitcoin del valore di 1300 dollari al mio indirizzo bitcoin   (se non hai la minima idea di come si faccia, ricerca tramite il browser: “Acquista Bitcoin”).   Il mio indirizzo bitcoin (BTC Wallet) è: 15qtzEtYCsaK4q1EbV4S4FyefNxPXrCTj9   Subito dopo aver confermato il tuo pagamento, cancellerò il video, e questo è tutto, non avrai mai più mie notizie.  Hai 2 giorni (48 ore) a disposizione per completare questa transazione.  Una volta che avrai aperto questa e-mail, riceverò una notifica, e sarà avviato il timer.   Qualsiasi tuo tentativo di sporgere denuncia sarà inutile, poiché questa e-mail non è riconducibile a me, la stessa cosa vale per il mio id bitcoin.  Ci lavoro da moltissimo tempo; non lascio spazio agli errori.    Se, per qualsiasi evenienza, scopro che hai condiviso questo messaggio con chiunque, distribuirò il tuo video come ho già detto.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Ciao!  Hai notato che ti ho inviato un’e-mail dal tuo account?  Sì, ciò significa semplicemente che ho l’accesso completo al tuo dispositivo.   È da un paio di mesi che ti tengo d’occhio.  Ti stai chiedendo come? Sei stato infettato da un malware mentre visitavi un sito web per adulti.   Forse non sai di che cosa sto parlando, ma cercherò di spiegartelo.  Attraverso il Trojan Virus, ho l’accesso completo a un PC o a qualsiasi altro dispositivo.  Ciò significa che posso controllarti in qualsiasi momento sul tuo schermo accendendo la tua telecamera e il tuo microfono, senza nemmeno che te ne accorga.  Inoltre, ho accesso all’elenco dei tuoi contatti e alla tua corrispondenza.   Forse ti starai chiedendo, “Ma sul mio PC è attivato l’antivirus, com’è possibile? Perché non ho ricevuto una notifica?”   Bene, la risposta è semplice; il mio malware usa i driver e aggiorno le firme ogni quattro ore, rendendolo non rilevabile e disattivando il tuo antivirus.   Ho un filmato di te mentre ti seghi sulla sinistra della schermo e il video che stavi guardando mentre ti masturbavi sulla destra dello schermo.  Vuoi sapere come potrebbe andare peggio? Con un semplice clic del mouse possono inviare questo video a tutti i tuoi social network e contatti e-mail.  Posso anche postare l’accesso in tutta la corrispondenza e nei messaggi e-mail.   Per evitare che tutto questo accada devi semplicemente trasferire bitcoin del valore di 1300 dollari al mio indirizzo bitcoin   (se non hai la minima idea di come si faccia, ricerca tramite il browser: “Acquista Bitcoin”).
