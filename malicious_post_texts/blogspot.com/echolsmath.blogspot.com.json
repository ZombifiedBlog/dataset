Well, it's the reality of the cryptocurrency market today.\r<br/> <br/>Raiblocks, a relatively obscure coin at the time, went from 0.20 on December first to $20 by New Year's Eve. It is now in the top 20 largest coins in the world.\r<br/> <br/>All that to say, the next big winner could be found anywhere, and today I believe I've identified the next one.\r<br/> <br/>After spending hundreds of hours looking at hundreds of different coins, I locked down on one specific target.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin.\r<br/> <br/>As the name says, this is a coin created and headquartered in Switzerland. It is one of the only coins in the world recognized as legal tender by the government.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin is allowed by the Swiss government and has the potential to climb more than 5,000% before the end of January and more than 50,000% before the end of this year.\r<br/> <br/>This is one of those rare buy-and-hold coins which you WANT to own, and hang onto for the long term, much like those people who bought bitcoin at $1 and kept it for 3 years. FYI, bitcoin is trading at $14,000 now. That's an increase of over 1 million percent.\r<br/> <br/>I recommend you consider putting at least a thousand bucks in Swisscoin immediately. This could quickly turn into enough money to buy a new house, or at the very least a new car.\r<br/> <br/>For those of you who already have bitcoins, all you need to do is open an account at <a href=\"http://coinexchange.io\">coinexchange.io</a> (this is the url/website, and it takes 1 minute to get setup), transfer some btc to your new account and buy SIC (Swisscoin).\r<br/> <br/>For those of you who are still clueless about Cryptos, the process will be a little bit longer but well worth it.\r<br/> <br/>Open an account at a large exchange such as Coinbase dot com or Coinmama dot com, then add some fund using your credit/debit card or Paypal.\r<br/> <br/>That's the fastest way, but you will be limited to a few hundred bucks at most. It should be enough to get you quickly started but consider adding more funds using a bank transfer so that you can really have skin in the game.\r<br/> <br/>Remember, every thousand bucks of SIC you buy today could easily turn into 500,000 by this time next year.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",
