I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!</div></div></div>\n</div>",

As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.

In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.

In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).

Having fun is ok with me, but is not ok with your reputation.<br/><br/>  Please dont blame me or yourself for this. You couldn't know that the camera was working.<br/>  I'm sure you don't want to be the next Jeffrey Toobin and get embarrassed in front of all your friends, family and colleagues.<br/>  You should get this very clear, I will send this video to all your contacts if I dont get paid.<br/>  Are you wondering how I got your contacts and emails? Through the same exploit, zoom app allowed me to extract all sensitive info from your device.<br/><br/>  So here is what we will do. You pay me $2000 in bitcoin, and nothing of this will happen. You have 2 days to make the payment.<br/>  After I get the money, I will delete the footage and information about you.

Just google on how to buy it, it's very easy to use and anonymous.<br/>  P.S. Don't try to report this to the police, I use TOR and bitcoin can't be traced. Do not email me back.

And I have very unfortunate news for you.I'll give you some background on what happened.There was a zero day security vulnerability on Zoom app, that allowed me a full time access to your camera and some other metadata on your account.Basically, you were hacked.And as you can imagine in your worst dreams, I have made a footage with you as a main actor.Where you work on yourself (perform sex act to be clear). Having fun is ok with me, but is not ok with your reputation.Please dont blame me or yourself for this. You couldn't know that the camera was working.I'm sure you don't want to be the next Jeffrey Toobin and get embarrassed in front of all your friends, family and colleagues.You should get this very clear, I will send this video to all your contacts if I dont get paid.Are you wondering how I got your contacts and emails? Through the same exploit, zoom app allowed me to extract all sensitive info from your device.So here is what we will do. You pay me $2000 in bitcoin, and nothing of this will happen. You have 2 days to make the payment.After I get the money, I will delete the footage and information about you. The amount is not negotiable.Send 0.11 Bitcoin (less than 2k USD at the current exchange rate) to my wallet 15AKuZPGMkdrpTGJwb87tnaqSyp91JSeeBHaving trouble with buying bitcoin? Just google on how to buy it, it's very easy to use and anonymous.P.S. Don't try to report this to the police, I use TOR and bitcoin can't be traced. Do not email me back. If you do something stupid, I will distribute the video.Good luck. Don’t stress.",

I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit.\r<br/> <br/>I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times.\r<br/> <br/>I know what you like hard funs (adult sites).\r<br/>Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone.\r<br/>Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ...

I definitely would not want to ...I will not do this if you pay me a little amount.I think $786 is a nice price for it!I accept only Bitcoins.My BTC wallet: 18cFCmESfC6PKn8LL6HPbtK2EWLLdsryXpIf you have difficulty with this - Ask Google \"how to make a payment on a bitcoin wallet\". It's easy.After receiving the above amount, all your data will be immediately removed automatically.My virus will also will be destroy itself from your operating system.My Trojan have auto alert, after this email is looked, I will be know it!You have 2 days (48 hours) for make a payment.If this does not happen - all your contacts will get crazy shots with your dirty life!And so that you do not obstruct me, your device will be locked (also after 48 hours)Do not take this frivolously!

El ser humano ha transformado el medio   natural desde el principio de los tiempos, lo cual ha supuesto un claro avance para sus sociedades; la agricultura, avances médicos, infraestructuras…El conjunto de todos estos avances, sin embargo, ha producido un cambio en la estructura de los ecosistemas   del planeta hasta el punto de ponerlos en grave peligro en muchos casos.Necesitamos nuevos cambios. Transformaciones que nos ayuden a modificar nuestra relación con el medio. Pero los cambios nunca fueron fáciles por cuanto suponen romper nuestros esquemas mentales y nuestras costumbres.Este mes os proponemos un listado de nuevos recursos que nos acerquen a la posibilidad del cambio que supondrá llegar a un verdadero desarrollo sostenible.Los fondos del CEDREAC están en permanente renovación. Todos los meses incorporamos al catálogo libros, juegos, DVDs y revistas.   A continuación, te presentamos los recursos existentes relacionados con el tema de este boletín. Para otras novedades, consulta en el Catálogo Virtual o en el tablón de anuncios del CEDREAC.Ecologíada (100 batallas) Medio ambiente y sociedad en la España recientePedro Costa Morata, Biblioteca Nueva, 2011El autor-protagonista va describiendo, como experiencia directa, muchos de los notables conflictos que han dado fuerza y personalidad al movimiento ecologista, uno de los fenómenos sociales más interesantes y trascendentes de los últimos cuarenta años.La oveja ShaunRichard Starzak, Mark Burton, 2015Cuando Shaun decide tomarse el día libre y divertirse un poco, se encuentra con que va a tener más acción de lo que esperaba. Las trastadas de Shaun acaban por lograr que se lleven al Granjero, así que Shaun y el rebaño han de viajar a la Gran Ciudad y rescatarle.   ¿Encontrará Shaun al Granjero en ese mundo extraño y desconocido?La granja urbanaNovella Carpenter, Capitan Carpenter, 2015Libro de memorias en el que medite sobre la vida urbana y sobre todo aquello que hemos dejado de vivir quienes habitamos las ciudades. Carpenter nos muestra que, a pesar del cansancio, los pequeños logros y las enormes decepciones, es posible crear un hogar   autosustentable en medio de una gran ciudad.La familia BélierEric Lartigau, 2014En la  familia Bélier, todos son sordos menos Paula. Ella es indispensable para sus padres en el día a día, sobre todo en la explotación de la granja familiar. Animada por su profesor de música, decide preparar la prueba para un concurso de radio nacional.   Una elección vital que podría significar alejarse de su familia y un paso inevitable hacia la edad adulta.Las fronteras de la ciencia: entre la ortodoxia y la herejíaMichael Shermer, Alba Editorial, 2010No es fácil determinar si una teoría novedosa, quizá revolucionaria, debe admitirse en el seno de la ciencia o considerarse pseudociencia. Criterios que deberían ser puramente objetivos se rigen demasiadas veces por la moral, los prejuicios y el conservadurismo.MañanaCyril Dion, Mélanie Laurent, 2015Tras la publicación de un estudio que anunciaba la posible desaparición de parte de la humanidad en 2100, Cyril Dion y Mélanie Laurent y un equipo de cuatro   personas visitan diez países para investigar las causas de la catástrofe y, sobre todo, la forma de evitarla. Durante su viaje, se encuentran con pioneros que reinventan la agricultura, la energía, la economía, la democracia y la educación.Los últimos tiempos del club del autobúsChris Stewart, Salamandra, 2015Veinte años después de instalarse en El Valero, un destartalado cortijo en la Alpujarra granadina, adonde llegó huyendo del mundanal ruido, Chris se enfrenta   a un acontecimiento trascendental en su vida familiar: su hija Chloé se dispone a abandonar el nido para asistir a la universidad.
