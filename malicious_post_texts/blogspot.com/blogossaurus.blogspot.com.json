I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.

Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.

In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.Wondering how bad this could get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $550 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:bc1qkccuh9pmxqcm3v7wwp6jpeatutza8ltas937f8After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this email cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",

In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",
