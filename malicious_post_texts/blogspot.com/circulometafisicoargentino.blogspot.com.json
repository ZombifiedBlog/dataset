It is a reminder about your dirty deeds!\r<br/> <br/>It has been around 4 months since your device that you use to access the internet, has been infected with spyware.\r<br/>I have been tracking your online activities for a long time by now.\r<br/> <br/>How it has become possible:\r<br/>Approximately half a year ago there was a huge leak of personal data (mainly passwords and logins), including your email provider (<a href=\"http://blogger.com\">blogger.com</a>).\r<br/>Professional hackers have used this data in order to access the operating systems of potential victims (including you as well), \r<br/>and installed special loaders that can be used to install absolutely anything to the infected devices.\r<br/> <br/>I would like to point out that antivirus companies are struggling to deal with such spyware since long time ago, \r<br/>because Trojan software codes keep continuously updating and hence, not allowing antiviruses to do anything.\r<br/> <br/>Likewise, all that personal data has become available at the black market and I have purchased it to install my spyware and start checking out people's personal information,\r<br/>hoping to find something interesting.\r<br/>Some people had a lot of boring documents, some people have basic games, while others play casino... all those devices have been utilized by us in order to do cryptocurrency mining.\r<br/>However, eventually I have stumbled upon something really special while checking your personal data!\r<br/> <br/>You are truly a huge fan of watching kinky videos (it is easy to confirm by checking the activity log of your multimedia players and browser history).\r<br/>I have been filtering out for some time the most shocking videos with you masturbating, while recording you via your device's camera and microphone.\r<br/>As result, I have generated sample videos exposing the way you are pleasing yourself (in really impressive manners sometimes), \r<br/>while the lower part of the screen plays the video that you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/> <br/>I have managed to create a really nice collection for the past few months!\r<br/>What do you think would happen, if those videos get shared to your colleagues, relatives and friends?\r<br/>Taking in consideration the \"specificity\" of the videos you had been watching, the opinion of your friends about your personality will be changed once and for all.\r<br/>I guess, you might have troubles with law due to certain videos from that collection...\r<br/>But I don't want to get you in this kind of troubles, since I have no interest in that.\r<br/> <br/>I simply want to get some money from you, since I have spent quite a significant amount of time and effort to get all this done!\r<br/>Let's agree like this: 1550$ (USD) of bitcoin equivalent will be good enough for me!
