As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).

( ~_^)\r<br/> <br/>Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).\r<br/>I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.\r<br/>I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.\r<br/>This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.\r<br/> <br/>Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...\r<br/> <br/>While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.\r<br/>You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.\r<br/>To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.\r<br/> <br/>If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.\r<br/>In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.\r<br/>I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.\r<br/> <br/>We can still resolve it in the following manner:\r<br/>You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.\r<br/>Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.\r<br/> <br/>It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.\r<br/>If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.\r<br/> <br/>My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1771s891APz1wNKdn5fe3Vknmf5pN18cWu\r<br/> <br/>You are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).\r<br/> <br/>Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).\r<br/>&gt; Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay. \r<br/>&gt; Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.\r<br/>&gt; Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.\r<br/> <br/>Things you should be concerned about:\r<br/>&gt; That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.\r<br/>Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).\r<br/>&gt; That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me. \r<br/>Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that.

Frankly speaking, malware has infected your devices and it's coming from an adult website, which you used to visit. \r<br/>Although all this stuff may seem unfamiliar to you, but let me try to explain that to you.\r<br/> <br/>With aid of Trojan Viruses, I managed to gain full access to any PC or other types of devices.\r<br/>That merely means that I can watch you whenever I want via your screen just by activating your camera as well as microphone, while you don't even know about that. \r<br/>Moreover, I have also received access to entire contacts list as well as full correspondence of yours.\r<br/> <br/>You may be wondering, \"However, my PC is protected by a legitimate antivirus, so how could that happen? Why couldn't I get any alerts?\" \r<br/>To be honest, the reply is quite straightforward: malware of mine utilizes drivers, which update the signatures on 4-hourly basis, \r<br/>which turns them to become untraceable, and hereby making your antivirus remain idle.\r<br/> <br/>I have collected a video on the left screen where you enjoy wanking, while the video on the right screen shows the video you were watching at that point of time.\r<br/>Still puzzled how much damage could that cause?

So I’ve had enough time to collect the information.I think you already know what is going to happen next.For a couple of month my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites you visit, websearches, texts you send.There is more to it, but I have listed just a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.To be clear, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well.It was just about right timing to get you privacy violated. I have made a few pornhub worthy videos with you as a lead actor.I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.Here is my offer. Let’s name this a “consulting fee” I need to get, so I can delete the media content I have been collecting.Your privacy stays untouched, if I get the payment.Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public website for perverts to view.You and I understand how damaging this will be to you, it's not that much money to keep your privacy.I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.I only care about getting paid.My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars to be transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1FLwiuF95C45se8VtxQ4g882Gfr7V3qQ3HThe fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.Obviously do not try to ask for help from the law enforcement unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.Take care and have a good day.",
