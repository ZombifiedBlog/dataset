I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi!Sadly, there are some bad news that you are about to hear.About few months ago I have gained a full access to all devices used by you for internet browsing.Shortly after, I started recording all internet activities done by you.Below is the sequence of events of how that happened:Earlier I purchased from hackers a unique access to diversified email accounts (at the moment, it is really easy to do using internet).As you can see, I managed to log in to your email account without breaking a sweat: (resolvemedia.online@blogger.com).Within one week afterwards, I installed a Trojan virus in your Operating Systems available on all devices that you utilize for logging in your email.To be frank, it was somewhat a very easy task (since you were kind enough to open some of links provided in your inbox emails).I know, you may be thinking now that I'm a genius.With help of that useful software, I am now able to gain access to all the controllers located in your devices (e.g., video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, managed to download all your photos, personal data, history of web browsing and other info to my servers without any problems.Moreover, I now have access to all accounts in your messengers, social networks, emails, contacts list, chat history - you name it.My Trojan virus continues refreshing its signatures in a non-stop manner (because it is operated by driver),hence it remains undetected by any antivirus software installed in your PC or device.So, I guess now you finally understand the reason why I could never be caught until this very letter...During the process of your personal info compilation, I could not help but notice that you are a huge admirer and regular guest of websites with adult content.You endure a lot of pleasure while checking out porn websites, watching nasty porn movies and reaching breathtaking orgasms.Let me be frank with you, it was really hard to resist from recording some of those naughty solo scenes with you in main role and compiling them in special videosthat expose your masturbation sessions, which end with you cumming.In case if you still have doubts, all I need is to click my mouse and all those nasty videos with you will be shared to friends, colleagues, and relatives of yours.Moreover, nothing stops me from uploading all that hot content online, so all public can watch it too.I sincerely hope, you would really not prefer that to happen, keeping in mind all the dirty things you like to watch,(you certainly know what I mean) it will completely ruin your reputation.However, don't worry, there is still a way to resolve this:You need to carry out a $1550 USD transfer to my wallet (equivalent amount in bitcoins depending on exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transaction, I will proceed with deleting all the filthy videos with you in main role.Afterwards, we can forget about this unpleasant accident. Furthermore, I guarantee that all the malicious software will also be erased from your devices and accounts.Mark my words, I never lie.That is a great bargain with a low price, I assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recordingand tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.In case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.Here is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 1LV8rSHsXYQ9JWUM4LRAGywH8RA6DXH6A7From now on, you have only 48 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, 2 days).The following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:> Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).> Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services.

But my malware intercepts it every time.\r<br/> <br/>How I made it:\r<br/>In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.\r<br/>I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.\r<br/>When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.\r<br/> <br/>After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).\r<br/> <br/>A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.\r<br/>But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!\r<br/>I'm talk you about sites for adults.\r<br/> <br/>I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!\r<br/> <br/>And I got an idea....\r<br/>I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).\r<br/>After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.\r<br/>Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!\r<br/> <br/>I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.\r<br/>I think $885 is a very, very small amount for my silence.\r<br/>Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!\r<br/> <br/>Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!\r<br/>My BTC wallet: 1QKG5uTDq1GU8iNYqycitEL9dv9dctoQsV\r<br/> <br/>You do not know how to use bitcoins?\r<br/>Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".\r<br/>It's extremely easy\r<br/> <br/>For this payment I give you two days (48 hours).\r<br/>As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.\r<br/> <br/>After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.\r<br/>If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".\r<br/> <br/>I hope you understand your situation.\r<br/>- Do not try to find and destroy my virus!
