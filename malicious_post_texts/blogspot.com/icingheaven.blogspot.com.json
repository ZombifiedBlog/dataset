Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.\r<br/> <br/>With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.\r<br/>This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.\r<br/> <br/>I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.\r<br/>Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.\r<br/>I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.\r<br/> <br/>All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").\r<br/> <br/>My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1\r<br/> <br/>After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.\r<br/>You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.\r<br/>Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.\r<br/> <br/>Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.\r<br/>I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake. \r<br/> <br/>If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",
