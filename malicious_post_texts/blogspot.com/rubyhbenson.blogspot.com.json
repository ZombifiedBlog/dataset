Here, is an attempt to help you understand</span> what is transliteration <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">process and how it differs from translation. There are even several examples here to help you better understand the concept of transliteration.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"seobox\">\n<h2 id=\"heading2\"><strong>What is Transliteration?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Transliteration is a process that involves converting a text in one language into a text in another language. Now, before you say, “isn’t that the same as a translation?” no, it isn’t. Let us explain why. In translation, the conversion of the text is such that it maintains its underlying meaning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">On the other hand, the text conversion in transliteration is more literal and does not bother with the underlying meaning. The process may seem the same for</span> transliteration and translation<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, but the outputs are very different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But, we can discuss the similarities and differences between</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">in the next section. What you need to know about transliteration is that it converts each character from one alphabet to another. In other words, transliteration replaces sounds phonetically in another language. However, this replacement does not apply to the word’s meaning.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:25px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img-with-aniamtion-wrap center\" data-animation=\"fade-in\" data-border-radius=\"none\" data-max-width=\"100%\" data-max-width-mobile=\"default\" data-shadow=\"none\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"hover-wrap\" data-hover-animation=\"none\">\n<div class=\"hover-wrap-inner\"><a class=\"center\" href=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/how-it-works/\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"direct mail operations\" class=\"img-with-animation skip-lazy\" data-animation=\"fade-in\" data-delay=\"0\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/direct-mail-operations-cta-1.png\" width=\"1024\"/></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:25px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading3\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Understanding Transliteration Using Examples</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Even with the explanation above, you may still be confused about the transliteration concept. It’s pretty normal to have these confusions, which is why we will help you understand</span> what transliteration means <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">with the help of an example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Let us consider the example of the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. The word KONNICHIWA in Japanese looks like this こんにちは. During</span> transliteration and translation<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, each word goes through a conversion process. So, the Japanese phrase こんにちは splits into pieces, as you see below.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">こ</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">KO</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">ん</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">N</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">に</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">NI</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">ち</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">CHI</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">は</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">HA or WA</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As you can see from the table above, the transliteration process becomes interesting as we reach the sound は. There are two possible transliterations for the sound は, which are HA and WA. So,</span> what does transliteration mean <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">in this situation?</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Transliteration Can Have Different Phonetic Matches</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the example we discussed above, we saw how a character by itself can have two different sounds. Here, you can see that the transliteration depends on the context and has other phonetic matches. It is the same as some English letters sounding different in words, such as the “c” in cold and city.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Transliteration Is Dependent On The Country</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Another thing you should know about transliteration is that it is also dependent on the country which uses or speaks a specific language. The best example of</span> what transliteration <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">means in this situation is the use of the letter “Z.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In most English-speaking countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc., the pronunciation of Z is ZED. But in the US, the letter Z is pronounced ZEE. It means you can not transliterate the letter Z without knowing the country and the language.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Transliteration Is Not Always Phonetic Conversion</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Usually, transliteration may seem like a phonetic conversion process, but that is not always the case. You need to consider</span> what does transliteration mean <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">if a character in one language has an equivalent in another language. Let’s also assume that the pronunciation of these characters is also different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For instance, take the letter Ö. You can usually find this letter in places that speak German languages, including German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic. The English transliteration of the letter Ö can be either O or OE. Here O and OE are considered equivalent.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Transliteration Is Not Romanisation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">People often confuse transliteration with</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">romanisation</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. However, they are not the same. A romanisation is a form of transliteration that does not use Roman characters, such as</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Arabic </span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Chinese</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Cyrillic </span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Japanese</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Korean</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">And more</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But in romanisation, the output is a language that does use Roman characters, such as </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">English</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">French</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">German</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Spanish</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Transliteration Involves Converting Numbers</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When you first asked yourself, “</span>what is transliteration?<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">” you probably did not think it involved converting numbers. Surprisingly enough, transliteration also involves converting numbers. For instance, transliteration can convert Roman numerals to Japanese numbers. The table below shows the transliteration of five roman numbers to Japanese numbers.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Roman Number</b></td>\n<td><b>Japanese Number</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I </span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">一</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">II</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">二</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">III</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">三</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">IV</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">四</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">V</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">五</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading4\" style=\"text-align:left;\">What Does Transliteration Mean In Address Verification?</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">By now, you have a good idea of</span> what is transliteration <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">and the process behind it. But, how does transliteration apply to address verification?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">First of all, the transliteration in address verification applies to your business if you have international customers and business partners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">So, let us say you have customer address data from every corner of the world. We are talking about addresses in different languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Arabic, etc. There is no way you can read all these languages by yourself and have no way of telling the customer’s location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This is a situation where transliteration can help your business. “But,</span> what does transliteration mean <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">in this situation?” you may wonder. Well, it allows you to spell out the addresses in different languages in your native language, which in this case is English.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Ensure CRM Compatibility</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Before searching for a transliteration tool for your business organisation, you should first</span> <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/direct-mail-crm/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">check your CRM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. If your business website or app already supports foreign languages, things should be pretty smooth and straightforward for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">On the other hand, if you are looking for transliteration capability for future international customers, ensure your CRM can keep up. Ask yourself,</span> what does transliteration mean <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">if your CRM cannot support different languages? Without a good CRM, you cannot provide the services you wish, even with transliteration.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Address Parsing and Address Standardisation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">An advanced</span> <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/address-verification-software/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">address verification tool</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">like <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/\">PostGrid</a> provides superior address parsing and standardisation capability. Our system breaks down your addresses into small units and rearranges them into a standard format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The standard format PostGrid is the official address format obtained directly from the official postal service provider. For UK addresses, PostGrid uses the standard address format defined by Royal Mail; for US addresses, it is USPS standard format and so on.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading5\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Transliteration vs Translation</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">We have already established that</span> transliteration and translation <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">are not the same. If you are unfamiliar with a language, translation and transliteration can give you a good idea of what a word means. However, you can not use translation and transliteration interchangeably.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Translation Is Interchangeable. Transliteration Is Not.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Let’s take the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. It will help you understand interchangeability in</span> translation vs transliteration<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. You can do an easy exercise here. Type in KONNICHIWA in Google translate in Japanese, which is こんにちは.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The result should say the translation of こんにちは is HELLO. Now, try the same by typing in the English word (HELLO) and looking at the result, and it should show こんにちは. In that sense, translation words are interchangeable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now, try to</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">transliterate the English word</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">HELLO and check the result. The Japanese transliteration of HELLO is ハロー. Here is where the</span> translate vs transliterate <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">argument becomes interesting. If you try to transliterate ハロー back to English, your result will be HARŌ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As you can see, transliteration is not a two-way street. It doesn’t work both ways like translation, and you may lose some information. More importantly, it is unlikely that you will get a meaningful word using transliteration.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"vc_custom_heading\" id=\"heading6\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Conclusion</h2>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element\">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>Business organisations with customers from all over the world can benefit from transliteration. It allows them to ensure the validity of addresses even if they are utterly alien to their customer’s native language.</p>\n<p>However, it is not the same as translation. A business organisation should never confuse transliteration and translation because their results can be entirely different. Transliteration does not take into account the underlying meaning of the words.</p>\n<p>Hence, the outcome of a transliteration process may seem random. However, transliterating specific phrases and numbers can be helpful for address verification. Investing in a robust address verification tool like PostGrid with <a href=\"https://www.postgrid.co.uk/bulk-mailing/\">bulk mailing</a> capability enables you to streamline communication with your domestic and international customers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"divider-wrap\" data-alignment=\"default\">\n<div class=\"divider\" style=\"height:15px;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div

Do you have trouble managing customer address data in foreign languages? If your answer is a yes to both these questions. In that case, using anaddress verification toolwith transliteration capability can be especially beneficial.Transliteration in address verification is a simple but often effective way for businesses to manage their international address data. But,what does transliteration mean? Is it just another fancy name for translation? These are questions that are likely on your mind right now.We promise that we will answer all your questions as you read further. Here, is an attempt to help you understandwhat is transliterationprocess and how it differs from translation. There are even several examples here to help you better understand the concept of transliteration.What is Transliteration?Transliteration is a process that involves converting a text in one language into a text in another language. Now, before you say, “isn’t that the same as a translation?” no, it isn’t. Let us explain why. In translation, the conversion of the text is such that it maintains its underlying meaning.On the other hand, the text conversion in transliteration is more literal and does not bother with the underlying meaning. The process may seem the same fortransliteration and translation, but the outputs are very different.But, we can discuss the similarities and differences betweentransliteration and translationin the next section. What you need to know about transliteration is that it converts each character from one alphabet to another. In other words, transliteration replaces sounds phonetically in another language. However, this replacement does not apply to the word’s meaning.Understanding Transliteration Using ExamplesEven with the explanation above, you may still be confused about the transliteration concept. It’s pretty normal to have these confusions, which is why we will help you understandwhat transliteration meanswith the help of an example.Let us consider the example of the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. The word KONNICHIWA in Japanese looks like this こんにちは. Duringtransliteration and translation, each word goes through a conversion process. So, the Japanese phrase こんにちは splits into pieces, as you see below.こKOんNにNIちCHIはHA or WAAs you can see from the table above, the transliteration process becomes interesting as we reach the sound は. There are two possible transliterations for the sound は, which are HA and WA. So,what does transliteration meanin this situation?Transliteration Can Have Different Phonetic MatchesIn the example we discussed above, we saw how a character by itself can have two different sounds. Here, you can see that the transliteration depends on the context and has other phonetic matches. It is the same as some English letters sounding different in words, such as the “c” in cold and city.Transliteration Is Dependent On The CountryAnother thing you should know about transliteration is that it is also dependent on the country which uses or speaks a specific language. The best example ofwhat transliterationmeans in this situation is the use of the letter “Z.”In most English-speaking countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc., the pronunciation of Z is ZED. But in the US, the letter Z is pronounced ZEE. It means you can not transliterate the letter Z without knowing the country and the language.Transliteration Is Not Always Phonetic ConversionUsually, transliteration may seem like a phonetic conversion process, but that is not always the case. You need to considerwhat does transliteration meanif a character in one language has an equivalent in another language. Let’s also assume that the pronunciation of these characters is also different.For instance, take the letter Ö. You can usually find this letter in places that speak German languages, including German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic. The English transliteration of the letter Ö can be either O or OE. Here O and OE are considered equivalent.Transliteration Is Not RomanisationPeople often confuse transliteration withromanisation. However, they are not the same. A romanisation is a form of transliteration that does not use Roman characters, such asArabicChineseCyrillicJapaneseKoreanAnd moreBut in romanisation, the output is a language that does use Roman characters, such asEnglishFrenchGermanSpanishTransliteration Involves Converting NumbersWhen you first asked yourself, “what is transliteration?” you probably did not think it involved converting numbers. Surprisingly enough, transliteration also involves converting numbers. For instance, transliteration can convert Roman numerals to Japanese numbers. The table below shows the transliteration of five roman numbers to Japanese numbers.Roman NumberJapanese NumberI一II二III三IV四V五What Does Transliteration Mean In Address Verification?By now, you have a good idea ofwhat is transliterationand the process behind it. But, how does transliteration apply to address verification?First of all, the transliteration in address verification applies to your business if you have international customers and business partners.So, let us say you have customer address data from every corner of the world. We are talking about addresses in different languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Arabic, etc. There is no way you can read all these languages by yourself and have no way of telling the customer’s location.This is a situation where transliteration can help your business. “But,what does transliteration meanin this situation?” you may wonder. Well, it allows you to spell out the addresses in different languages in your native language, which in this case is English.Ensure CRM CompatibilityBefore searching for a transliteration tool for your business organisation, you should firstcheck your CRM. If your business website or app already supports foreign languages, things should be pretty smooth and straightforward for you.On the other hand, if you are looking for transliteration capability for future international customers, ensure your CRM can keep up. Ask yourself,what does transliteration meanif your CRM cannot support different languages? Without a good CRM, you cannot provide the services you wish, even with transliteration.Address Parsing and Address StandardisationAn advancedaddress verification toollikePostGridprovides superior address parsing and standardisation capability. Our system breaks down your addresses into small units and rearranges them into a standard format.The standard format PostGrid is the official address format obtained directly from the official postal service provider. For UK addresses, PostGrid uses the standard address format defined by Royal Mail; for US addresses, it is USPS standard format and so on.Transliteration vs TranslationWe have already established thattransliteration and translationare not the same. If you are unfamiliar with a language, translation and transliteration can give you a good idea of what a word means. However, you can not use translation and transliteration interchangeably.Translation Is Interchangeable. Transliteration Is Not.Let’s take the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. It will help you understand interchangeability intranslation vs transliteration. You can do an easy exercise here. Type in KONNICHIWA in Google translate in Japanese, which is こんにちは.The result should say the translation of こんにちは is HELLO. Now, try the same by typing in the English word (HELLO) and looking at the result, and it should show こんにちは. In that sense, translation words are interchangeable.Now, try totransliterate the English wordHELLO and check the result. The Japanese transliteration of HELLO is ハロー. Here is where thetranslate vs transliterateargument becomes interesting. If you try to transliterate ハロー back to English, your result will be HARŌ.As you can see, transliteration is not a two-way street. It doesn’t work both ways like translation, and you may lose some information. More importantly, it is unlikely that you will get a meaningful word using transliteration.ConclusionBusiness organisations with customers from all over the world can benefit from transliteration. It allows them to ensure the validity of addresses even if they are utterly alien to their customer’s native language.However, it is not the same as translation. A business organisation should never confuse transliteration and translation because their results can be entirely different. Transliteration does not take into account the underlying meaning of the words.Hence, the outcome of a transliteration process may seem random. However, transliterating specific phrases and numbers can be helpful for address verification.

        "cleaned_post_text": "TABLE OF CONTENTSREQUEST A DEMOWhat Is Transliteration, And How Can It Help Your Business Communication?Does your business have a customer database that crosses numerous countries? Do you have trouble managing customer address data in foreign languages? If your answer is a yes to both these questions. In that case, using an address verification tool with transliteration capability can be especially beneficial.Transliteration in address verification is a simple but often effective way for businesses to manage their international address data. But,what does transliteration mean? Is it just another fancy name for translation? These are questions that are likely on your mind right now.We promise that we will answer all your questions as you read further. Here, is an attempt to help you understandwhat is transliterationprocess and how it differs from translation. There are even several examples here to help you better understand the concept of transliteration.What is Transliteration?Transliteration is a process that involves converting a text in one language into text in another language. Now, before you say, “isn’t that the same as a translation?” no, it isn’t. Let us explain why. In translation, the conversion of the text is such that it maintains its underlying meaning.On the other hand, the text conversion in transliteration is more literal and does not bother with the underlying meaning. The process may seem the same fortransliteration and translation, but the outputs are very different.But, we can discuss the similarities and differences betweentransliteration and translationin the next section. What you need to know about transliteration is that it converts each character from one alphabet to another. In other words, transliteration replaces sounds phonetically in another language. However, this replacement does not apply to the word’s meaning.Understanding Transliteration Using ExamplesEven with the explanation above, you may still be confused about the transliteration concept. It’s pretty normal to have these confusions, which is why we will help you understandwhat does transliteration meanwith the help of an example.Let us consider the example of the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. The word KONNICHIWA in Japanese looks like this こんにちは. Duringtransliteration and translation, each word goes through a conversion process. So, the Japanese phrase こんにちは splits into pieces, as you see below.こKOんNにNIちCHIはHA or WAAs you can see from the table above, the transliteration process becomes interesting as we reach the sound は. There are two possible transliterations for the sound は, which are HA and WA. So,what does transliteration meanin this situation?Transliteration Can Have Different Phonetic MatchesIn the example we discussed above, we saw how a character by itself can have two different sounds. Here, you can see that the transliteration depends on the context and has other phonetic matches. It is the same as some English letters sounding different in words, such as the “c” in cold and city.Transliteration Is Dependent On The CountryAnother thing you should know about transliteration is that it is also dependent on the country which uses or speaks a specific language. The best example ofwhat does transliterationmeans in this situation is the use of the letter “Z.”In most English-speaking countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc., the pronunciation of Z is ZED. But in the US, the letter Z is pronounced ZEE. It means you can not transliterate the letter Z without knowing the country and the language.Transliteration Is Not Always Phonetic ConversionUsually, transliteration may seem like a phonetic conversion process, but that is not always the case. You need to considerwhat does transliteration meanif a character in one language has an equivalent in another language. Let’s also assume that the pronunciation of these characters is also different.For instance, take the letter Ö. You can usually find this letter in places that speak German languages, including German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic. The English transliteration of the letter Ö can be either O or OE. Here O and OE are considered equivalent.Transliteration Is Not RomanisationPeople often confuse transliteration withromanisation. However, they are not the same. A romanisation is a form of transliteration that does not use Roman characters, such asArabicChineseCyrillicJapaneseKoreanAnd moreBut in romanisation, the output is a language that does use Roman characters, such asEnglishFrenchGermanSpanishTransliteration Involves Converting NumbersWhen you first asked yourself, “what is transliteration?” you probably did not think it involved converting numbers. Surprisingly enough, transliteration also involves converting numbers. For instance, transliteration can convert Roman numerals to Japanese numbers. The table below shows the transliteration of five roman numbers to Japanese numbers.Roman NumberJapanese NumberI一II二III三IV四V五What Does Transliteration Mean In Address Verification?By now, you have a good idea ofwhat is transliterationand the process behind it. But, how does transliteration apply to address verification?First of all, the transliteration in address verification applies to your business if you have international customers and business partners.So, let us say you have customer address data from every corner of the world. We are talking about addresses in different languages, such as Chinese, Russian, Arabic, etc. There is no way you can read all these languages by yourself and have no way of telling the customer’s location.This is a situation where transliteration can help your business. “But,what does transliteration meanin this situation?” you may wonder. Well, it allows you to spell out the addresses in different languages in your native language, which in this case is English.Ensure CRM CompatibilityBefore searching for a transliteration tool for your business organisation, you should firstcheck your CRM. If your business website or app already supports foreign languages, things should be pretty smooth and straightforward for you.On the other hand, if you are looking for transliteration capability for future international customers, ensure your CRM can keep up. Ask yourself,what does transliteration meanif your CRM cannot support different languages. Without a good CRM, you cannot provide the services you wish, even with transliteration.Address Parsing and Address StandardisationAn advancedaddress verification toollikePostGridprovides superior address parsing and standardisation capability. Our system breaks down your addresses into small units and rearranges them into a standard format.The standard format PostGrid is the official address format obtained directly from the official postal service provider. For UK addresses, PostGrid uses the standard address format defined by Royal Mail; for US addresses, it is USPS standard format and so on.Transliteration vs TranslationWe have already established thattransliteration and translationare not the same. If you are unfamiliar with a language, translation and transliteration can give you a good idea of what a word means. However, you can not use translation and transliteration interchangeably.Translation Is Interchangeable. Transliteration Is Not.Let’s take the Japanese word KONNICHIWA. It will help you understand interchangeability intranslation vs transliteration. You can do an easy exercise here. Type in KONNICHIWA in Google translate in Japanese, which is こんにちは.The result should say the translation of こんにちは is HELLO. Now, try the same by typing in the English word (HELLO) and looking at the result, and it should show こんにちは. In that sense, translation words are interchangeable.Now, try totransliterate the English wordHELLO and check the result. The Japanese transliteration of HELLO is ハロー. Here is where thetranslate vs transliterateargument becomes interesting. If you try to transliterate ハロー back to English, your result will be HARŌ.As you can see, transliteration is not a two-way street. It doesn’t work both ways like translation, and you may lose some information. More importantly, it is unlikely that you will get a meaningful word using transliteration.ConclusionBusiness organisations with customers from all over the world can benefit from transliteration. It allows them to ensure the validity of addresses even if they are utterly alien to their customer’s native language.However, it is not the same as translation. A business organisation should never confusetransliteration and translationbecause their results can be entirely different. Transliteration does not take into account the underlying meaning of the words.Hence, the outcome of a transliteration process may seem random. However, transliterating specific phrases and numbers can be helpful for address verification.
