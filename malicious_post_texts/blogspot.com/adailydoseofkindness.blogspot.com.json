It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen.
