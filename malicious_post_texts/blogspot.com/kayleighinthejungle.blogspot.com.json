I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that. \r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1\r<br/> <br/>You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.\r<br/>Following that, the video will be posted on the web!\r<br/> <br/>Remember! Time tracking will start as soon as you open this email, I am monitoring this! \r<br/> <br/>Good luck and take it easy!

I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that.My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.Following that, the video will be posted on the web!Remember! Time tracking will start as soon as you open this email, I am monitoring this!Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",

It´s full of hills (That are just SO much fun to climb haha) and trees and houses and people and everyone is going about a million miles per hour.... basically the opposite of David! The ward is small, but our area is GIGANTIC. It´s been fun trying to learn it all haha!

He was in Panamá all week, and had a special conference with all the missionaries in Panamá City and the surrounding zones. What a blessing it was to be there. I have no doubt that he was/is called of God. We got to shake his hand... he looked each of us in the eye and said, ¨Hello Elder/Sister¨. When it was my turn, it couldn´t have lasted more than 3 seconds, but I went back to my seat in tears. The spirit was that strong. He spoke about a lot of things, but the thing that really stuck out to me was his counsel to teach the Plan of Salvation. He said that it should always come back to that. Whatever problem an investigator or less-active may have, stems from a lack of understanding or faith in the simple doctrine of the great Plan of Happiness. We are children of God, we have a purpose here on this earth, and we have a grand goal we are striving to achieve. I know that the plan of salvation is real and true!!

In Panama!! I can hardly believe it! It has been a crazy 5 days to say the least. I LOVE PANAMA. My area is right outside of the city David... its a really large, poor area and the people are very calm and go with the flow. My trainer is amazing. Her name is Hermana Peralta and basically I love her to death.... she is a really hard worker, and we have so much fun together! She is from Mexico, but she speaks a decent amount of English so we are able to communicate pretty well. I feel really blessed to have her as a companion, I am learning so much(: Our house is a pretty typical house for Panama... but it is completely different from the US. All of the houses here are made of cinderblocks and have concrete floors.... I'll try to figure out how to send pictures haha. But it's not too bad other than the fact that we live with a bat who likes to make an appearance every now and then haha.... we will be having companionship study and all of a sudden it's duck and cover because the bat swoops in. Panama. Here in Panama I am what they call a \"gringa\" (white girl) and it's quite funny because people will stop and stare, and everyone we walk up to wants to talk to me in English. It's actually a pretty good ice breaker to be honest(: But it is a different experience to be sure. The mosquitos have no mercy. I counted this morning a total of 114 on my legs.... Killer. But like I said I love it here.... the people are amazing. The other night we had dinner at a less active family's house... and it was a really cool experience. It was amazing to me because we sat in this house that only had a dirt floor and two chairs, and ate rice and chicken because that's all the family could afford... and we had so much fun! Their little boy came up to me and showed me his collection of water bottle caps, and we sat there and played a counting game with them for a good 30 minutes. We just sat their and talked, and they were helping me with my spanish, and we were just enjoying each others company. It was humbling! Panama is amazing. Sometimes it is so hard to be here, because my spanish is aweful and life here is so different... but then I have an experience like that and I remember that this is not about me. This is the work of the Savior, I am his representative. I feel so blessed to be able to witness the change in a persons face when Holy Ghost testifies to them that he is their Savior and that this is his Gospel. It is a privilidge to be apart of this work! I don't have a lot of time... but I love you all and I hope you have a wonderful week!! Remember who you are. </span></div>\n<div>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br/></span></div>\n<div>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hermana Van Deusen</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b5clVTnAkHw/VzpKrrk-_GI/AAAAAAAABZc/ReYVpTdPnSczwVjgjbaZTXKJt2NFkpzfACLcB/s1600/DSC00270.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b5clVTnAkHw/VzpKrrk-_GI/AAAAAAAABZc/ReYVpTdPnSczwVjgjbaZTXKJt2NFkpzfACLcB/s320/DSC00270.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uprRuRBL8hs/VzpKCNYc7OI/AAAAAAAABZE/9ZXLQAsVqk0PoWzQ_JnlxGJocwH8W1O0QCLcB/s1600/DSC00247.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uprRuRBL8hs/VzpKCNYc7OI/AAAAAAAABZE/9ZXLQAsVqk0PoWzQ_JnlxGJocwH8W1O0QCLcB/s320/DSC00247.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XKw8WcPRQq4/VzpKFGMOsKI/AAAAAAAABZM/MgNUIzc2OyYVU3c_5QkVAlE-3nlYE4TSgCLcB/s1600/DSC00248.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XKw8WcPRQq4/VzpKFGMOsKI/AAAAAAAABZM/MgNUIzc2OyYVU3c_5QkVAlE-3nlYE4TSgCLcB/s320/DSC00248.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H9MeOsnGCAs/VzpKrcQ9DxI/AAAAAAAABZY/jUP6MWXGxHAbdLvzZpoZibJFzM5CUzQ6QCLcB/s1600/DSC00250.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H9MeOsnGCAs/VzpKrcQ9DxI/AAAAAAAABZY/jUP6MWXGxHAbdLvzZpoZibJFzM5CUzQ6QCLcB/s320/DSC00250.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4l_uIvrYA-U/VzpKqkrtL0I/AAAAAAAABZU/BnEwzsadE7EPDAkgCqxecvHed76a0C0TACLcB/s1600/DSC00265.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4l_uIvrYA-U/VzpKqkrtL0I/AAAAAAAABZU/BnEwzsadE7EPDAkgCqxecvHed76a0C0TACLcB/s320/DSC00265.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<br/></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CXedDCIrliE/VzpK62AxJdI/AAAAAAAABZg/vW3yu-W6QXoXDYEIk9uYnFpI4wru40CyQCLcB/s1600/DSC00282.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CXedDCIrliE/VzpK62AxJdI/AAAAAAAABZg/vW3yu-W6QXoXDYEIk9uYnFpI4wru40CyQCLcB/s320/DSC00282.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY2IRyQBNBs/VzpKCBGBuFI/AAAAAAAABZI/VFSKVD_ASz8N2So_Au0OQlkNcD4hq5htgCLcB/s1600/DSC00236.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NY2IRyQBNBs/VzpKCBGBuFI/AAAAAAAABZI/VFSKVD_ASz8N2So_Au0OQlkNcD4hq5htgCLcB/s320/DSC00236.JPG\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

My area is right outside of the city David... its a really large, poor area and the people are very calm and go with the flow. My trainer is amazing. Her name is Hermana Peralta and basically I love her to death.... she is a really hard worker, and we have so much fun together! She is from Mexico, but she speaks a decent amount of English so we are able to communicate pretty well. I feel really blessed to have her as a companion, I am learning so much(: Our house is a pretty typical house for Panama... but it is completely different from the US. All of the houses here are made of cinderblocks and have concrete floors.... I'll try to figure out how to send pictures haha.
