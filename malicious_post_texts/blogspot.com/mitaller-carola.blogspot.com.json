Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1LqSNBE9rcvypxXF8fiBE88YenJsRfvsEZ   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

        "post_text": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\nHi there!   I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Transfer $1330 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1MQj3F Sm2kcent MBiDfNZj AMP4VYf QRriC  Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring.   An important notice: I have specified my Bitcoin wallet with spaces, hence once you carry out a transfer,   please make sure that you key-in my bitcoin address without spaces to be sure that your funds successfully reach my wallet!   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!    \n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 12nEVuGNtRFMVjeVmLtD4nt2sHX68S47yH   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!<o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.\r<br/> <br/>With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.\r<br/>This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.\r<br/> <br/>I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.\r<br/>Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.\r<br/>I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.\r<br/> <br/>All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $950 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").\r<br/> <br/>My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 15WXLWo8mH79dJiUiHJ7UMgrpXD33ky9XU\r<br/> <br/>After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.\r<br/>You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.\r<br/>Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.\r<br/> <br/>Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.\r<br/>I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake. \r<br/> <br/>If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hello there!Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.Below, is the sequence of past events:In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (nickel20.febrero@blogger.com).A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).All smart things are quite straightforward. (>_<)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1750 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1FhTVkgUpVyWNRG8bJkgyJipEmoEtitZwdYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours.

You're right!But the fact is that when you change the password, my trojan always saves a new one!I've been watching you for a few months now.The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.Why your antivirus did not detect malware?Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $731 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: “Buy Bitcoin”).My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1PNpAXTo6jh4V9dhXRvimNYqPYjvZEnQiuAfter receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.I give you 48 hours to pay.I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.I do not make any mistakes.If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.Best wishes!",
