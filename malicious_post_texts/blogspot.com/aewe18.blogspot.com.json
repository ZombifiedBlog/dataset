Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.\r<br/>Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1350 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it's not very difficult.\r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 14X4HmqJKQWCrNY9gthXVyPRa6KZhEkkmT\r<br/> <br/>You have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/> <br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that, the video will be posted on the web!\r<br/> <br/>P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).\r<br/> <br/>Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",
