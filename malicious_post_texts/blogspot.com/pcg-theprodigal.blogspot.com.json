I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I am a professional hacker and you were under my observation for quite some time now.  Nowadays, it is not really hard to organize, mostly for IT enthusiast like me.    You may be wondering, how did I manage to spy on you?   Well, there are plenty of harmful websites out there and it turns out that you like to visit them during your free time.   As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).   Here is my Bitcoin address: 18bSTrufLfuvHwS7JYuF626MBGULSmxTgR    I really want to settle this situation in a peaceful manner and I believe you want that too.

One mouse click is enough to send that video to your entire list of social network, as well as e-mail contacts.In addition, I can as well provide access to your entire e-mail correspondence as well as messengers that are currently in your use.All you need to do to in order to avoid that from occurring - transfer $1550 (USD) in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address(if you still don't know how that could be done, just use your browser and key-in: \"Buy Bitcoin\").Below is bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) of mine: 16trAbrqfAkfpN2zoJ2gQQdsYebkspgHpQUpon getting evidence of payment from your side, I will instantly proceed with removing those videos, and that is all, you won't ever hear about me anymore.You are left with 2 days (or 48 hours) to perform that transaction.After opening this e-mail, I will get a notice, which will automatically start my timer countdown.Any attempts to complain to authorities won't be of any use to you, because this e-mail is simply untraceable, just like Bitcoin ID of mine.I was working on this for quite an extended period of time; so do not even think that I can make a mistake.In event that, I occasionally discover that you shared this message with anyone else,I will straight away proceed with making your video public as stated earlier.Good luck.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have to share bad news with you.Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Here is the sequence of events:Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (pcg.bartonchurch.prodigal@blogger.com).One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).All ingenious is simple. ;)This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.Let's settle it this way:You transfer $1650 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1ND3JTwUaYWhDjTuaAK8idmpmuRQGqAkB1You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!Everything will be done in a fair manner!One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (pcg.bartonchurch.prodigal@blogger.com).Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).Yeah, geniuses are among us.Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1r8KDQsoFUWLdV1D2L1vc66YibNDrrYysAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success.

I have made a few pornhub worthy videos with you as a lead actor.I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.Here is my offer. Let’s name this a “consulting fee” I need to get, so I can delete the media content I have been collecting.Your privacy stays untouched, if I get the payment.Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public website for perverts to view.You and I understand how damaging this will be to you, it's not that much money to keep your privacy.I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.I only care about getting paid.My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars to be transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1FLwiuF95C45se8VtxQ4g882Gfr7V3qQ3HThe fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.Obviously do not try to ask for help from the law enforcement unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hello there!Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.Below, is the sequence of past events:In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (pcg.bartonchurch.prodigal@blogger.com).A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).All smart things are quite straightforward. (>_<)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1B5ic9iQpyafTEfWxHM4Xq6PkzbickrL8gYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

Once you complete the transaction - I will be able to see and confirm that.Please, do not try replying me via this email - there is no point in that (I have generated the header of this email as well as return address).Remember that there is no point to complain anywhere, since I cannot be found (Bitcoin system is anonymous and I am also using I2P network in order to access your device).I have considered all the small details.In case, if 48 hours after you have opened this email,I still don't receive the required amount of money, then your videoclip will be automatically sent to all your contact list and uploaded to public websites.Good luck and please don't hate me too much!This is life! You are merely out of luck this time.Who knows, maybe next time you will get lucky at something else...",

Moreover, it provides me with access to your camera and microphone.\r<br/>Likewise, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I have come up with an awesome idea to create the video in one part of the screen, which shows the way you cum, while the original video was simultaneously playing on another screen.

(All your data is already uploaded to a remote server)- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.P.S. I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim.This is a hacker code of honor.From now on, I advise you to use good antiviruses and update them regularly (several times a day)!Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.Farewell.",

Both are easy to do.First option: you ignore this email.The second option: you pay me $750(USD).Let's look at 2 options in detail.The first option is to ignore this email.Let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.I will send your video to your contacts, including family members, colleagues, etc.This does not protect you from the humiliation that you andyour family need to know when friends and family members know about your unpleasant details.The second option is to pay me. We will call this \"privacy advice.\"Now let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.Your secret is your secret. I immediately destroy the video.You continue your life as if none of this has happened.Now you might think: \"I'll call to police!\"Undoubtedly, I have taken steps to ensure that this letter cannot be traced to me,and it will not remain aloof from the evidence of the destruction of your daily life.I don't want to steal all your savings.I just want to get compensation for my efforts that I put in to investigate you.Let us hope that you decide to create all this in full and pay me a fee for confidentiality.You make a Bitcoin payment (if you don't know how to do it, just enter \"how to buy bitcoins\" in Google search)Shipping amount: $750(USD).Getting Bitcoin Addresses: 1GF8J1XRaiX2oHM7SQo9VAFAtWZcRgMncg(This is sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully)Don't tell anyone what to use bitcoins for. The procedure for obtaining bitcoins can take several days, so do not wait.I have a spetial code in Trojan, and now I know that you have read this letter.You have 48 hours to pay.If I don't get BitCoins, I'll send your video to your contacts, including close relatives, co-workers, and so on.Start looking for the best excuse for friends and family before they all know.But if I get paid, I immediately delete the video.This is a one-time offer that is non-negotiable, so do not waste my and your time.Time is running out.Bye!",
