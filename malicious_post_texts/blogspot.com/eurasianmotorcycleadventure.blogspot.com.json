Furthermore, I guarantee that all the malicious software will also be erased from your devices and accounts. \r<br/>Mark my words, I never lie.\r<br/> <br/>That is a great bargain with a low price, I assure you, because I have spent a lot of effort while recording \r<br/>and tracking down all your activities and dirty deeds during a long period of time.\r<br/>In case if you have no idea how to buy and transfer bitcoins - feel free to check the related info on the internet.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet for your reference: 1LrBGezKti4m2cov7CKuurLnCfQvjp2o1A\r<br/> <br/>From now on, you have only 48 hours and countdown has started once you opened this very email (in other words, 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>The following list contains things you should definitely abstain from doing or even attempting:\r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to reply this email (since the email is generated inside your inbox alongside with return address).\r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to call or report to police or any other security services. In addition, it's a bad idea if you want to share it with your friends, \r<br/> hoping they would help. If I happen to find out (knowing my awesome skills, it can be done effortlessly,\r<br/> because I have all your devices and accounts under my control and unceasing observation) - kinky videos of yours will be share to public the same day. \r<br/>&gt; Abstain from trying to look for me - that would not lead anywhere either.

In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.Wondering how bad this could get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: bc1qxv34ptq9rglp3wd42zdkfjx35dmdrqw36r7w0fAfter receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this email cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",

Well, it's the reality of the cryptocurrency market today.\r<br/> <br/>Raiblocks, a relatively obscure coin at the time, went from 0.20 on December first to $20 by New Year's Eve. It is now in the top 20 largest coins in the world.\r<br/> <br/>All that to say, the next big winner could be found anywhere, and today I believe I've identified the next one.\r<br/> <br/>After spending hundreds of hours looking at hundreds of different coins, I locked down on one specific target.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin.\r<br/> <br/>As the name says, this is a coin created and headquartered in Switzerland. It is one of the only coins in the world recognized as legal tender by the government.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin is allowed by the Swiss government and has the potential to climb more than 5,000% before the end of January and more than 50,000% before the end of this year.\r<br/> <br/>This is one of those rare buy-and-hold coins which you WANT to own, and hang onto for the long term, much like those people who bought bitcoin at $1 and kept it for 3 years.
