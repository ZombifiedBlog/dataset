Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1750 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it's not very difficult.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1HiTbewnp8XNHy2zdeYQTG3NAicRG7CzuTYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that, the video will be posted on the web!P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",

You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.\r<br/> <br/>With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.\r<br/>This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible?

In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts.I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1AbhXaiFxR52NDTrjAtzsdyhooVNoVchy1After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again.You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction.Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking.Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id.I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake.If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.",
