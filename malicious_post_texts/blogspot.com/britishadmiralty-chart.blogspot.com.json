I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

You have nothing to worry about,\r<br/>because I keep my word at all times.\r<br/> <br/>That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\r<br/>taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\r<br/>If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\r<br/> <br/>Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1EhjD4hzLpwuHVu52ScHTJASqPdkC6SD4\r<br/> <br/>All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\r<br/>&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\r<br/>&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\r<br/> If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - \r<br/> your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away. \r<br/>&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\r<br/>&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away.

Don't worry, I am a man of my word.It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1LzA9kzQkGDTYSfbbLE8gK5RAJ5ke32ntCYou are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay.> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hello there!Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.Below, is the sequence of past events:In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (peter.clarke.charts41@blogger.com).A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).All smart things are quite straightforward. (>_<)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1300 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 13Hayv2eeuwHTcUNhZVeCJytdBQosoSwVqYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours.

I am going to explain to you everything right now. \r<br/> <br/>I have access to your electronic devices, which are the part of the local network you regularly use. \r<br/>I have been tracking your activity for the last few months. \r<br/> <br/>How did that happen?\r<br/>You visited some hacked adult websites with Exploit, and your device was exposed to my malicious software (I bought it in Darknet from specialists in this field).\r<br/>This is a very complex software, operating as Trojan Horse. It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it. \r<br/>The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network. \r<br/> <br/>It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now, \r<br/>I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc. \r<br/> <br/>Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun! \r<br/> <br/>Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario. \r<br/> <br/>With that in mind, here is my proposal: \r<br/>Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently. \r<br/> <br/>In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work. \r<br/>If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that. \r<br/> <br/>My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1\r<br/> <br/>You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind: \r<br/>It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.\r<br/>It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked. \r<br/>Everything has been orchestrated precisely. \r<br/> <br/>If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.\r<br/>Following that, the video will be posted on the web!\r<br/> <br/>Remember! Time tracking will start as soon as you open this email, I am monitoring this! \r<br/> <br/>Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

It updates regularly, and your antivirus can not detect it.The program has a keylogger; it can turn your camera and microphone on and off, send files and provide access to your local network.It took me some time to get access to the information from other devices, and as of now,I have all your contacts with conversations, info about your locations, what you like, your favourite websites, etc.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a couple clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1650 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.If you don't know how to use Bitcoins, search it in Bing or Google 'how can I purchase Bitcoins' or other stuff like that.My Bitcoin wallet: 1Cg1X5xS6wkLqPksNcsVzm41Mf24PsrE1You have 55 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.Following that, the video will be posted on the web!Remember! Time tracking will start as soon as you open this email, I am monitoring this!Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",

I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it's not very difficult.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 16EuKQaCEEeba1Us68P9RwKjc8HTT4zWRRYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it. Following that, the video will be posted on the web!P.S. The time will start once you open this letter. (This program has a built-in timer).Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, next time please be careful.",

I immediately destroy the video.You continue your life as if none of this has happened.Now you might think: \"I'll call to police!\"Undoubtedly, I have taken steps to ensure that this letter cannot be traced to me,and it will not remain aloof from the evidence of the destruction of your daily life.I don't want to steal all your savings.I just want to get compensation for my efforts that I put in to investigate you.Let us hope that you decide to create all this in full and pay me a fee for confidentiality.You make a Bitcoin payment (if you don't know how to do it, just enter \"how to buy bitcoins\" in Google search)Shipping amount: $750(USD).Getting Bitcoin Addresses: 1GF8J1XRaiX2oHM7SQo9VAFAtWZcRgMncg(This is sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully)Don't tell anyone what to use bitcoins for. The procedure for obtaining bitcoins can take several days, so do not wait.I have a spetial code in Trojan, and now I know that you have read this letter.You have 48 hours to pay.If I don't get BitCoins, I'll send your video to your contacts, including close relatives, co-workers, and so on.Start looking for the best excuse for friends and family before they all know.But if I get paid, I immediately delete the video.This is a one-time offer that is non-negotiable, so do not waste my and your time.Time is running out.Bye!",
