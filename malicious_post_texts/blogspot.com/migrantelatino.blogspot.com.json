I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 18JafCUSR3JWJuxbSH9Wp4AUizzTwkZz9D   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

( ~_~)Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.We can still resolve it in the following manner:You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 13jKLyAFhjVRiWyg1TTPVjweFBAyUyBiy8You are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay.> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi there!I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (rtu1.migrantelatino1@blogger.com).Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).Yeah, geniuses are among us.Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,because I keep my word at all times.That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1r8KDQsoFUWLdV1D2L1vc66YibNDrrYysAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.Things that may be concerning you:> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.",

I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.\r<br/> <br/>This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.\r<br/>In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.\r<br/> <br/>Here is my bitcoin wallet: 12djMjPKd6Bv2BaXUNVuAjnuusKA66qCkX\r<br/> <br/>You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).\r<br/> <br/>Things you need to avoid from doing:\r<br/>*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).\r<br/>*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. \r<br/>*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless.

I guarantee that I will also delete all the data and videos permanently once the payment is received.In my opinion, this is a so-called modest payment for my hard work.You can easily figure out how to purchase Bitcoins with help of search engines like Google or Bing, because that it’s not difficult at all.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 1Eo9FKmAkNg8UAR4xj6F15Y53phFutzSysYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me — the email address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the mail as well as my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been organized with precision.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this mail to anyone – the abovementioned video will be immediately shared, and your entire contacts list will be the first to receive it. Afterwards, the video will be posted on the web!P.S. The countdown timer will automatically start once you open this mail. (This program has a built-in timer).Good luck and take it easy! It was just bad luck, so next time please be more careful.",
