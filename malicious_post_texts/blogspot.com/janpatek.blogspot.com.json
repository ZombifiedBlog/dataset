Today is the first day of our 12 Days After Christmas Sale.  Day 1 is <b><i><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:#330000;\"><a href=\"http://janpatekquilts.goodsie.com/patterns\">Patterns</a></span></i></b>.  All of our patterns are on sale for $3.00 off with the exception of our BOM's which are $10.00 off.<div><br/></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color:#000000;\"><a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-2P1auOLlK_s/Tvis9I_H2GI/AAAAAAAAB6k/ooVheaveOE4/s1600/Day%2B1%2B-%2Bpatterns.JPG\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><br/></a></span><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5690488295566858338\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-2P1auOLlK_s/Tvis9I_H2GI/AAAAAAAAB6k/ooVheaveOE4/s400/Day%2B1%2B-%2Bpatterns.JPG\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;\"/></div><div><br/></div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Now for the \"love\" technology part.  Our store has \"coupons\" but they can't be assigned to individual groups of products.  So we'll do it manually.  When you purchase the patterns at store the checkout will charge you the regular price.  Then Byron will refund your PayPal Account the amount of the discount.  Or call him at 816-632-7632 to place your order and charge it to your credit card there.  You can leave the order on the Voicemail if you see this after hours.  And type in \"Holiday\" or mention it on the phone and get free shipping to the continental US for all orders over $30.00.</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Whew!</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Now for the rest of the \"Love Technology\" part.
