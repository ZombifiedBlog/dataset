I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously.   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1490 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1M6WbcKrAu3WtyTSUz1hk4eaHRD3oUNKtp   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.   Good luck!</div></div></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

(>_<)The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.Let's resolve it like this:All you need is $1450 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 15KquhG7RGkyXvEVT1aXLgPt4qgBEVe8rNYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you.\r<br/> <br/>With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device.\r<br/>This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence.\r<br/> <br/>You may be asking yourself, \"But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?\" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent.\r<br/> <br/>I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating.\r<br/>Wondering how bad could this get?
