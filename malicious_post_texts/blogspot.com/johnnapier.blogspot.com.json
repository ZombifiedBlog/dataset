I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1250 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1MSafx9aRzRybiqgGJnH1Ah4EJz5usuSxy   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Don't worry, I am a man of my word.It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1LzA9kzQkGDTYSfbbLE8gK5RAJ5ke32ntCYou are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay.> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.Things you should be concerned about:> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me.Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago!It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.",

One mouse click is enough for me to share this video to your social networks, as well as e-mail contacts of yours.In addition, I am also able to gain access to all e-mail correspondence as well as messengers used by you.Below are simple steps required for you to undertake in order to avoid that from occurring - transfer $1350 in Bitcoin equivalent to my wallet(if you don't know how to complete that, just open your browser and make a google search: \"Buy Bitcoin\").My bitcoin wallet address (BTC Wallet) is: 14dbcD3gXf5eHkYuA2PYf2nakQ5B7hVqHjOnce the payment has been confirmed, I shall remove the video without delay, and that is end of story - afterwards you won't hear about me again for sure.The time for you to perform the transaction is 2 days (48 hours).After this e-mail is opened by you, I will get an automatic notice, which will start my timer.Any effort to complain will not change anything at all, because this e-mail is simply untraceable, just like my bitcoin address.I have been developing these plans for quite an extended period of time; so, don't expect any mistake from my side.If, get to know that you tried to send this message to anyone else, I will distribute your video as described earlier.",

Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 19AXt8DjBCJEXaoqYf3hF7UieTjKpT5GkmYou have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!Everything will be done in a fair manner!One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Greetings!I have to share bad news with you.Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.Here is the sequence of events:Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (jaynapes.bobber@blogger.com).One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).All ingenious is simple. =)This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.Let's settle it this way:You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1xPr18gM8YKsaiUkGz9MgpjtwcBQcME2iYou have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).Things you need to avoid from doing:*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.Things you don't need to worry about:*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!Everything will be done in a fair manner!One more thing...

Well, it's the reality of the cryptocurrency market today.\r<br/> <br/>Raiblocks, a relatively obscure coin at the time, went from 0.20 on December first to $20 by New Year's Eve. It is now in the top 20 largest coins in the world.\r<br/> <br/>All that to say, the next big winner could be found anywhere, and today I believe I've identified the next one.\r<br/> <br/>After spending hundreds of hours looking at hundreds of different coins, I locked down on one specific target.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin.\r<br/> <br/>As the name says, this is a coin created and headquartered in Switzerland. It is one of the only coins in the world recognized as legal tender by the government.\r<br/> <br/>Swisscoin is allowed by the Swiss government and has the potential to climb more than 5,000% before the end of January and more than 50,000% before the end of this year.\r<br/> <br/>This is one of those rare buy-and-hold coins which you WANT to own, and hang onto for the long term, much like those people who bought bitcoin at $1 and kept it for 3 years. FYI, bitcoin is trading at $14,000 now. That's an increase of over 1 million percent.\r<br/> <br/>I recommend you consider putting at least a thousand bucks in Swisscoin immediately.

It should be enough to get you quickly started but consider adding more funds using a bank transfer so that you can really have skin in the game.\r<br/> <br/>Remember, every thousand bucks of SIC you buy today could easily turn into 500,000 by this time next year.\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",
