Be sure, I keep my promises.That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1P9V9BQ83wdEXGm3KmGxXMAdCVeXSd5W3ZYou are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:> That I will not receive the money you transferred.- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!Everything will be carried out based on fairness!Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.",

I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.    Besides that, there are plenty of P2P services that can transfer the required Bitcoin amount to my wallet in exchange for funds transfer from your bank card (Visa, MasterCard or Maestro).   Here is my Bitcoin address: 18bSTrufLfuvHwS7JYuF626MBGULSmxTgR    I really want to settle this situation in a peaceful manner and I believe you want that too.    Nothing personal, it is simply my job.   Make sure you use valid Antivirus software and stay away from unwanted websites.

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╭ ᑎ ╮   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 850 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1Jv4gYRkCiDQqBQvdmDW9c2Dqwg1pYfn6y   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

Let’s name this a “consulting fee” I need to get, so I can delete the media content I have been collecting.Your privacy stays untouched, if I get the payment.Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public website for perverts to view.You and I understand how damaging this will be to you, it's not that much money to keep your privacy.I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.I only care about getting paid.My modest consulting fee is 1700 US Dollars to be transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 18YFLJHGufQQukMFRkJJJiz51mp21qN96pThe fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.Obviously do not try to ask for help from the law enforcement unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.Take care and have a good day.",

I have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website.<br/>  This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that I have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and that’s why this type of an attack can go undetected.<br/>  You only need one not patched vulnerability to be infected, and unfortunately for you – it works that simple.<br/><br/>  You were not targeted specifically, but just became one of the quite a few unlucky people who got hacked that day.<br/>  All of this happened a few month ago. So I’ve had time to collect information on you.<br/><br/>  I think you already know what is going to happen next.<br/>  During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.<br/>  There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.<br/><br/>  For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.<br/>  It was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated.<br/><br/>  I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.<br/>  So here is my offer. I need a consulting fee to delete the media content I have been collecting.<br/>  Your privacy stays untouched, if I get paid.<br/>  Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore.<br/><br/>  I understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.<br/>  Please dont blame me – we all have different ways of making a living.<br/><br/>  I have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if I get paid.<br/>  I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.<br/>  I only care about getting paid.<br/><br/>  My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.<br/>  You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1HSb4fZHmyNro5LGyjQFpcDwqKjRUqJhh2<br/><br/>  The fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.<br/>  We use Bitcoin to protect my identity.<br/><br/>  Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated.<br/>  I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.<br/><br/>  Take care.<br/><o:p></o:p></p></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

Yoúr fantasy ís shífted far away from the normal coúrse!And í got an ídea...Í took a screenshot of an adúlt sítes where yoú had fún (yoú únderstand what í mean, ríght?).After that, í took a screenshot of yoúr mastúrbatíon (úsíng the camera of yoúr devíce) and glúed them together.Túrned oút amazíng! Yoú are so spectacúlar!Í'm know that yoú woúld not líke to show these screenshots to yoúr fríends, relatíves or colleagúes.Ít wíll be a húge shame for yoú!Í thínk $1490(USD) ís a very, very small amoúnt for my sílence.Besídes, í have been spyíng on yoú for so long, havíng spent a lot of tíme!Pay ONLY ín Bítcoíns!My BTc wallet: 1HBxxRcb38Q8xmfsGsJAqvgHi4GZBzwM6KYoú do not know how to úse bítcoíns?Enter a qúery ín any search engíne: \"how to replenísh btc wallet\".Ít's extremely easy!Í wíll gíve yoú exactly two days (48 hoúrs) to make thís payment.As soon as yoú open thís letter, the tímer wíll work and tíme wíll pass.After payment, my vírús and dírty screenshots wíth yoúr mastúrbatíon wíll be self-destrúct aútomatícally.Íf í do not receíve from yoú the specífíed amoúnt, then yoúr devíce wíll be locked, and all yoúr contacts wíll receíve a screenshots wíth yoúr \"enjoy\".Í hope yoú únderstand yoúr sítúatíon.- Do not try to fínd and destroy my vírús!

Including <a href=\"mailto:dixisdixis.7777@blogger.com\">dixisdixis.7777@blogger.com</a>.\r<br/>It is easy to check - I wrote you this email from your account.\r<br/> <br/>Moreover, I know your intim secret, and I have proof of this.\r<br/>You do not know me personally, and no one paid me to check you.\r<br/> <br/>It is just a coincidence that I discovered your mistake.\r<br/>In fact, I posted a malicious code (exploit) to an adult site, and you visited this site... \r<br/> <br/>While watching a video Trojan virus has been installed on your device through an exploit.\r<br/>This darknet software working as RDP (remote-controlled desktop), which has a keylogger,\r<br/>which gave me access to your microphone and webcam.\r<br/>Soon after, my software received all your contacts from your messenger, social network and email.\r<br/> <br/>At that moment I spent much more time than I should have. \r<br/>I studied your love life and created a good video series.\r<br/>The first part shows the video that you watched,\r<br/>and the second part shows the video clip taken from your webcam (you are doing inappropriate things).\r<br/> <br/>Honestly, I want to forget all the information about you and allow you to continue your daily life.\r<br/>And I will give you two suitable options. Both are easy to do.\r<br/>First option: you ignore this email.\r<br/>The second option: you pay me $764(USD).\r<br/> <br/>Let's look at 2 options in detail.\r<br/> <br/>The first option is to ignore this email.\r<br/>Let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.\r<br/>I will send your video to your contacts, including family members, colleagues, etc.\r<br/>This does not protect you from the humiliation that you and\r<br/>your family need to know when friends and family members know about your unpleasant details.\r<br/> <br/>The second option is to pay me. We will call this \"privacy advice.\"\r<br/>Now let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.\r<br/>Your secret is your secret. I immediately destroy the video.\r<br/>You continue your life as if none of this has happened.\r<br/> <br/>Now you might think: \"I'll call to police!\"\r<br/>Undoubtedly, I have taken steps to ensure that this letter cannot be traced to me,\r<br/>and it will not remain aloof from the evidence of the destruction of your daily life.\r<br/>I don't want to steal all your savings.\r<br/>I just want to get compensation for my efforts that I put in to investigate you.\r<br/>Let us hope that you decide to create all this in full and pay me a fee for confidentiality.\r<br/>You make a Bitcoin payment (if you don't know how to do it, just enter \"how to buy bitcoins\" in Google search)\r<br/> <br/>Shipping amount: $786(USD).\r<br/>Getting Bitcoin Addresses: 14t1ovSs6XGBCi6BwZAQ4kPCJ3dnUapQTv\r<br/>(This is sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully)\r<br/> <br/>Don't tell anyone what to use bitcoins for.

Includingdixisdixis.7777@blogger.com.It is easy to check - I wrote you this email from your account.Moreover, I know your intim secret, and I have proof of this.You do not know me personally, and no one paid me to check you.It is just a coincidence that I discovered your mistake.In fact, I posted a malicious code (exploit) to an adult site, and you visited this site...While watching a video Trojan virus has been installed on your device through an exploit.This darknet software working as RDP (remote-controlled desktop), which has a keylogger,which gave me access to your microphone and webcam.Soon after, my software received all your contacts from your messenger, social network and email.At that moment I spent much more time than I should have.I studied your love life and created a good video series.The first part shows the video that you watched,and the second part shows the video clip taken from your webcam (you are doing inappropriate things).Honestly, I want to forget all the information about you and allow you to continue your daily life.And I will give you two suitable options. Both are easy to do.First option: you ignore this email.The second option: you pay me $764(USD).Let's look at 2 options in detail.The first option is to ignore this email.Let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.I will send your video to your contacts, including family members, colleagues, etc.This does not protect you from the humiliation that you andyour family need to know when friends and family members know about your unpleasant details.The second option is to pay me. We will call this \"privacy advice.\"Now let me tell you what happens if you choose this path.Your secret is your secret. I immediately destroy the video.You continue your life as if none of this has happened.Now you might think: \"I'll call to police!\"Undoubtedly, I have taken steps to ensure that this letter cannot be traced to me,and it will not remain aloof from the evidence of the destruction of your daily life.I don't want to steal all your savings.I just want to get compensation for my efforts that I put in to investigate you.Let us hope that you decide to create all this in full and pay me a fee for confidentiality.You make a Bitcoin payment (if you don't know how to do it, just enter \"how to buy bitcoins\" in Google search)Shipping amount: $786(USD).Getting Bitcoin Addresses: 14t1ovSs6XGBCi6BwZAQ4kPCJ3dnUapQTv(This is sensitive, so copy and paste it carefully)Don't tell anyone what to use bitcoins for. The procedure for obtaining bitcoins can take several days, so do not wait.I have a spetial code in Trojan, and now I know that you have read this letter.You have 48 hours to pay.If I don't get BitCoins, I'll send your video to your contacts, including close relatives, co-workers, and so on.Start looking for the best excuse for friends and family before they all know.But if I get paid, I immediately delete the video.This is a one-time offer that is non-negotiable, so do not waste my and your time.Time is running out.Bye!",

But my malware intercepts it every time.\r<br/> <br/>How I made it:\r<br/>In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.\r<br/>I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.\r<br/>When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.\r<br/> <br/>After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).\r<br/> <br/>A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.\r<br/>But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!\r<br/>I'm talk you about sites for adults.\r<br/> <br/>I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!\r<br/> <br/>And I got an idea....\r<br/>I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).\r<br/>After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.\r<br/>Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!\r<br/> <br/>I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.\r<br/>I think $736 is a very, very small amount for my silence.\r<br/>Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!\r<br/> <br/>Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!\r<br/>My BTC wallet: 1H1K8MfLEJgjCCfDEkTJmv9GJjD3XzEFGR\r<br/> <br/>You do not know how to use bitcoins?\r<br/>Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".\r<br/>It's extremely easy\r<br/> <br/>For this payment I give you two days (48 hours).\r<br/>As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.\r<br/> <br/>After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.\r<br/>If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".\r<br/> <br/>I hope you understand your situation.\r<br/>- Do not try to find and destroy my virus!

But my malware intercepts it every time.How I made it:In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!I'm talk you about sites for adults.I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!And I got an idea....I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.I think $736 is a very, very small amount for my silence.Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!My BTC wallet: 1H1K8MfLEJgjCCfDEkTJmv9GJjD3XzEFGRYou do not know how to use bitcoins?Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".It's extremely easyFor this payment I give you two days (48 hours).As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".I hope you understand your situation.- Do not try to find and destroy my virus!

You are so spectacular!I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.I think $760 is a very, very small amount for my silence.Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!My BTC wallet: 182PJESsEWbuJ8PEgfM58p64jbok3i1gNUYou do not know how to use bitcoins?Enter a query in any search engine: \"how to replenish btc wallet\".It's extremely easyFor this payment I give you two days (48 hours).As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your \"enjoys\".I hope you understand your situation.- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server.P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment!This is the word of honor hackerI also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation.Do not hold evil! I just do my job.Good luck.",
