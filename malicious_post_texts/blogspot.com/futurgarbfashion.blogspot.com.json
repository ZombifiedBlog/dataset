I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.  Currently I have gained full access to your account.    In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.   The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. ╰-⋃-╯   Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.  It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.   In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.   You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.   Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,   which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.   I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,   while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ   All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC.   Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.   I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.   Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 890 USD to my Bitcoin account   (that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).   Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 18JafCUSR3JWJuxbSH9Wp4AUizzTwkZz9D   Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.   Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).   I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.   Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.  If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

I also recorded several filthy scenes with you in the main focus and montaged some dirty videos, which demonstrate your passionate masturbation and cum sessions.In case you still don't believe me, all I need is just one-two mouse clicks to make all your unmasking videos become available to your friends, colleagues, and even relatives.Well, if you still doubt me, I can easily make recorded videos of your orgasms become a public.I truly believe that you surely would avoid that from happening,taking in consideration the type of the XXX videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of what I mean) it will result in a huge disaster for you.Well, there is still a way to settle this tricky situation in a peaceful manner:You will need to transfer $960 USD to my account (refer to Bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate at the moment transfer),so once funds transfer is complete, I will straight away proceed with deleting all that dirty content from servers once and for all.Afterwards, you can consider that we never met before. You have my honest word, that all the harmful software will also be deactivated and deleted from all your devices currently in use.Worry not, I keep my promises.That is truly a win-win solution that comes at a relatively reduced cost, mostly knowing how much effort I spent on monitoring your profile and traffic for a considerably long time.In event that you have no idea about means of buying and transferring bitcoins – don't hesitate to use any search engine for your assistance (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.).My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 19yaJM8qhsyXnwoQP7zQbMkqJStoMYxPmEI have allocated 48 hours for you to do that, and the timer started right after you opened this very email (2 days to be exact).Don't even think of doing anything of the following:*Abstain from attempting to reply me (this email was created by me inside your inbox page and the return address was generated accordingly).*Abstain from attempting to get in touch with police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing this to you friends.Once I discover this (apparently, that is absolutely easy for me, taking in consideration that I have complete control over all systems you use) - your kinky video will straight away be made public.*Don't even think of attempting to find me – that is completely useless. Don't forget that all cryptocurrency transactions remain completely anonymous.*Don't attempt reinstalling the OS on all your devices or getting rid of them. That won't lead you to success either, because I have already saved all videos at my remote servers as a backup.Things you should not be concerned about:*That your funds transfer won't reach my wallet.- Worry not, I can see everything, hence after you finish the transfer, I will get a notification right away(trojan virus of mine uses a remote-control feature, which functions similarly to TeamViewer).*That I will still distribute your videos although you make the funds transfer.- My word, I have no intention or interest in continuing making your life troublesome.Anyway, If I truly wanted that, it would happen long time ago without me notifying you!Everything can be settled in a peaceful and just way!And lastly... make sure you don't get caught afterwards in such type of incidents anymore!My fair advice – ensure you change all your passwords on a regular basis.",

As result, my spyware has downloaded to your device. This spyware detects all image-format files on iOS devices (HEIF, HEVC or JPEG) as well as Android (JPEG, JPG or HEIC) devices.   The most interesting part is that whenever you connect to WIFI or to mobile network (3G/4G+/H+/LTE),   all your photos get quietly synchronized in silent mode to my own cloud storage.    I have collected sufficient content in order to share to public your undisguised photos in social networks,   like Instagram or Facebook in a form of new posts or news, or via personal messages of WhatsApp Viber, Telegram etc.    Hence, even if you delete those photos from your device, I still have got a copy of them in my cloud, so you won’t be able to delete them as well.   In order to avoid 🔥 YOUR UNCENSORED HOT NEWS 🔥 being shared to your contacts,   I can suggest a fair deal to you. This deal is valid within 72 hours.    Based on this deal, you need to transfer 1000 USD (in Bitcoin equivalent) to my bitcoin wallet and after that I will completely disappear from your life.   In event that you are still unaware about how to complete bitcoin funds transfer,   you can easily solve this issue by Googling \"Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card or Debit Card\" or something similar.

I have used a Zero Day vulnerability with a special code to infect your device through a website.<br/>  This is a complicated software that requires precise skills that I have. It works as a chain with specially crafted and unique code and that’s why this type of an attack can go undetected.<br/>  You only need one not patched vulnerability to be infected, and unfortunately for you – it works that simple.<br/><br/>  You were not targeted specifically, but just became one of the quite a few unlucky people who got hacked that day.<br/>  All of this happened a few month ago. So I’ve had time to collect information on you.<br/><br/>  I think you already know what is going to happen next.<br/>  During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.<br/>  There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.<br/><br/>  For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.<br/>  It was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated.<br/><br/>  I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.<br/>  So here is my offer. I need a consulting fee to delete the media content I have been collecting.<br/>  Your privacy stays untouched, if I get paid.<br/>  Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore.<br/><br/>  I understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.<br/>  Please dont blame me – we all have different ways of making a living.<br/><br/>  I have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if I get paid.<br/>  I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.<br/>  I only care about getting paid.<br/><br/>  My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.<br/>  You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1HSb4fZHmyNro5LGyjQFpcDwqKjRUqJhh2<br/><br/>  The fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.<br/>  We use Bitcoin to protect my identity.<br/><br/>  Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated.<br/>  I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.<br/><br/>  Take care.<br/></div></div></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>",

So I’ve had time to collect information on you.I think you already know what is going to happen next.During that time, my software was quietly collecting information about your habits, websites that you visit, searches you do, texts you send.There is more to it, but I have listed a few reasons for you to understand how serious this is.For you to clearly understand, my software controlled your camera and microphone as well and it was impossible for you to know about it.It was just about right timing for me to get you privacy violated.I’ve been waiting enough and have decided that it’s time to put an end to this.So here is my offer. I need a consulting fee to delete the media content I have been collecting.Your privacy stays untouched, if I get paid.Otherwise, I will leak the most damaging content to your contacts and post it to a public tube for perverts to explore.I understand how damaging this will be for you, and amount is not that big for you to keep your privacy.Please dont blame me – we all have different ways of making a living.I have no intention of destroying your reputation or life, but only if I get paid.I don’t care about you personally, that's why you can be sure that all files I have and software on your device will be deleted immediately after I receive the transfer.I only care about getting paid.My modest consulting fee is 1650 US Dollars transferred in Bitcoin. Exchange rate at the time of the transfer.You need to send that amount to this wallet: 1HSb4fZHmyNro5LGyjQFpcDwqKjRUqJhh2The fee is non negotiable, to be transferred within 2 business days.We use Bitcoin to protect my identity.Obviously do not try to ask for any help from anybody unless you want your privacy to be violated.I will monitor your every move until I get paid. If you keep your end of the agreement, you wont hear from me ever again.Take care.",

        "cleaned_post_text": "Hi!Unfortunately, I have some bad news for you.Several months ago, I got access to the device you are using to browse the internet.Since that time, I have been monitoring your internet activity.Being a regular visitor of adult websites, I can confirm that it is you who is responsible for this.To keep it simple, the websites you visited provided me with access to your data.I’ve uploaded a Trojan horse on the driver basis that updates its signature several times per day, to make it impossible for antivirus to detect it. Additionally, it gives me access to your camera and microphone.Moreover, I have backed-up all the data, including photos, social media, chats and contacts.Just recently, I came up with an awesome idea to create the video where you cum in one part of the screen, while the video was simultaneously playing on another screen. That was fun!Rest assured that I can easily send this video to all your contacts with a few clicks, and I assume that you would like to prevent this scenario.With that in mind, here is my proposal:Transfer the amount equivalent to 1500 USD to my Bitcoin wallet, and I will forget about the entire thing. I will also delete all data and videos permanently.In my opinion, this is a somewhat modest price for my work.You can figure out how to purchase Bitcoins using search engines like Google or Bing, seeing that it’s not very difficult.My Bitcoin wallet (BTC): 13dk8JbVeEKGmHq7aevbdVxjg2cHYFT4kgYou have 48 hours to reply and you should also bear the following in mind:It makes no sense to reply me - the address has been generated automatically.It makes no sense to complain either, since the letter along with my Bitcoin wallet cannot be tracked.Everything has been orchestrated precisely.If I ever detect that you mentioned anything about this letter to anyone - the video will be immediately shared, and your contacts will be the first to receive it.
