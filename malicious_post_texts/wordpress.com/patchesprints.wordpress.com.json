A great day to show you some of my red quilts, actually ALL of my red quilts, red quilts described as predominately red. I do have others where red is a main component but also other colors combined with red. So today. . . just RED!</p>\n<p>The first quilt pictured brings me back to the old shop days. We made this quilt to showcase some great red homespun fabrics. This is a log cabin design shaped to make hearts. The red fabrics are always fun to use as you can mix and match. This one happens to be hand quilted too. Gonna use this on my kitchen table today. Yes, I am cooking today (as most of you know, I usually do NOT choose to cook) but we are going out tomorrow to celebrate Valentine’s Day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-260\" data-attachment-id=\"260\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1329303295\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0388\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/valentines-day-red-quilts/img_0388/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0388.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0388\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>The next two quilts go together. First is Ruby Slippers (yes, for the “Oz” fanatic) by Terry Atkinson from the book <a href=\"http://store.atkinsondesigns.com/stores_app/browse_item_details_ws.asp?shopper_id=9485119174419485&amp;store_id=913&amp;page_id=23&amp;item_id=1002\">Kansas City Scrapbook</a>. I do a lot of Atkinson Design quilts. They are so fun, so easy and just go together so nicely. I taught this quilt at one of our winter retreats and made up some different names based on the fabric  choices. We had Blue Suede Shoes, Saddle Shoes, Patent Leather Shoes, Pink Ballet slippers and of course the Ruby Slippers. Whenever I teach a quilt that has connecting corner blocks, I always suggest to the class that they keep the triangles that they cut off from the corners and use the “mini” triangles for another quilt. For this little mini I used the scraps from Ruby Slippers and made up broken dishes blocks. I called this little mini “Leftovers” and look closely to see how it is displayed in my “Oz” room. More “Oz” to come in a future post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-259\" data-attachment-id=\"259\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1329303259\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0387\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=225\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/valentines-day-red-quilts/img_0387/\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=225 225w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=450 450w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0387.jpg?w=113 113w\" title=\"IMG_0387\" width=\"225\"/></a><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-257\" data-attachment-id=\"257\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1329302569\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0385\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/valentines-day-red-quilts/img_0385/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_0385.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0385\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>Finally a basketful of RED, another shop sample mini we did with lace doilies, a mini I bought at a quilt show and two redwork quilts.

About two months ago it looked like the numbers were going to be down but as we got closer to the day, registrations continued and a few changes brought the count up to 42 attending. It was lots of fun with three days of sewing, some shopping and good times with friends.</p>\n<p>The Abbey is a beautiful location for the quilt retreat. The rooms are awesome, some with a view of the lake and others with pretty courtyards and the changing leaves. Many people arrive on Thursday night so they can be all ready for 9am Friday for the sewing to begin. We sew most of the day on Friday, take a break about 3pm to go over to the Stitchery in Delavan. Nancy and Carrie, owners of the Stitchery, have been inviting us to their store for many years for wine, cheese and shopping. Their kits are always very popular, especially for the holidays. A favorite this year was the “Tumber” patterns for the turkey, pumpkin and Santa.</p>\n<p>We also were treated to shopping right in the sewing room. Therese from That Quilt Shop in Woodstock brought fabric, kits, books and patterns and also organized the “Jelly Roll Race” on Saturday night. And the winner . . . was Sherrie. It was fun to see all the finished Jelly Roll quilts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-108\" data-attachment-id=\"108\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1320619651\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"Fall Retreat 2011 033\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2011/11/10/fall-quilt-retreat-2011/fall-retreat-2011-033/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fall-retreat-2011-033.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"Fall Retreat 2011 033\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>On Saturday, the group welcomed Maria’s daughter who brought bags from Thirty-One. There were so many choices. Lots of us ordered the organizational utility tote and lunch tote. If you missed out, check out their <a href=\"http://www.thirtyonegifts.com/\">website</a> and contact Maria.</p>\n<p>With 42 people sewing non-stop for three days, we saw a variety of projects and also shared ideas and techniques. Newer quilters were able to get help from many people. And its much more fun to sew and chat and catch up on whats been going on with everyone.

        "cleaned_post_text": "We had a great weekend at The Abbey for the annual Fall Quilt Retreat. About two months ago it looked like the numbers were going to be down but as we got closer to the day, registrations continued and a few changes brought the count up to 42 attending. It was lots of fun with three days of sewing, some shopping and good times with friends.The Abbey is a beautiful location for the quilt retreat. The rooms are awesome, some with a view of the lake and others with pretty courtyards and the changing leaves. Many people arrive on Thursday night so they can be all ready for 9am Friday for the sewing to begin. We sew most of the day on Friday, take a break about 3pm to go over to the Stitchery in Delavan. Nancy and Carrie, owners of the Stitchery, have been inviting us to their store for many years for wine, cheese and shopping. Their kits are always very popular, especially for the holidays. A favorite this year was the “Tumber” patterns for the turkey, pumpkin and Santa.We also were treated to shopping right in the sewing room. Therese from That Quilt Shop in Woodstock brought fabric, kits, books and patterns and also organized the “Jelly Roll Race” on Saturday night. And the winner . . . was Sherrie. It was fun to see all the finished Jelly Roll quilts.On Saturday, the group welcomed Maria’s daughter who brought bags from Thirty-One. There were so many choices. Lots of us ordered the organizational utility tote and lunch tote. If you missed out, check out theirwebsiteand contact Maria.With 42 people sewing non-stop for three days, we saw a variety of projects and also shared ideas and techniques. Newer quilters were able to get help from many people. And its much more fun to sew and chat and catch up on whats been going on with everyone. There was a lot of holiday sewing (including two Grinch quilts), at least three Twist and Turn quilts, two Lucky Stars and lots more.We always have Show and Tell on Sunday morning before everyone packs up and heads for home. All the quilts were unique and beautiful but there was one quilt that really stood out. Caren Z.’s quilt (a Nancy Martin design) was absolutely gorgeous.Its about 12 weeks till the next event,Winter Retreatat Sheraton Suites Elk Grove – can’t wait! And looking forward to next year at the Abbey too.",

I’ve been doing a little traveling, just returning from California, visiting my daughter Michelle who recently moved to the Los Angeles area. It was a wonderful trip, we did some real touristy things including being part of the live studio audience at The Talk and also got her set with groceries and other things to start out life in California. A few weekends ago,  I accompanied my friends (Ginny, Pam, Connie and Deb) to Junk Bonanza in Shakopee, Minnesota. Again, not so much quilting . . . but the junking does relate to my quilting as I’m working on re-doing my sewing room and using some of the fun “junk” to re-organize fabric, wool, patterns, books and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-78\" data-attachment-id=\"78\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1316257280\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0013\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/junk-bonanza/img_0013/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_0013.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0013\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>Junk Bonanza is an annual event run by Ki Nassauer (pictured with me above). Ki is the original “Junk Lady” going to flea markets, garage sales, salvage yards and more, repurposing and recycling items into decorative objects. Junk Bonanza combines “junk” and antiques at Canterbury Park, a racetrack in Shakopee. We drove up to Minnesota on Thursday, stopping at a few antique shops along the way. Our good friend, Connie, lives in Eaton MN. We arrived at her house that evening and enjoyed an excellent dinner before getting ready for our junking adventure the next day.</p>\n<p>Lots of treasures at Junk Bonanza on Friday, we went from booth to booth and also met Ki and got her to sign her latest copy of Flea Market Style. Read more at <a href=\"http://fleamarketstylemag.blogspot.com/\">Ki’s blog</a> and you’ll see why we enjoy “junking” so much! Another fun part of Junk Bonanza is the bloody mary served up by Canterbury Park (Connie and Pam pictured with theirs below). If you are a fan of bloody marys, you ‘ll love these, especially the garnish which includes a shrimp, marinated garlic stuffed in a pepper, salami and cheese chunk and MORE!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-79\" data-attachment-id=\"79\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1316270940\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0014\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/junk-bonanza/img_0014-2/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_00141.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0014\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>So following the break for Bloody Mary, we continued to “junk” with everyone finding lots of fun stuff. If this were a junking blog I would certainly detail all the finds but let’s just say, we all found our treasures, including jewelry, an old pharmacy cabinet, a seed packet stand with table, chairs and a lamp. The picture at the end of this post shows my purchases. The fun items for my revamped sewing room are the white drawer and the old mini-muffin tin. I’m going to use the drawer for my wool pieces, washed the drawer out thoroughly and sprayed with sealer. The muffin tin will be used for some kinds of odds and ends, buttons, bobbins, something.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-90\" data-attachment-id=\"90\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1316279602\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0016\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/junk-bonanza/img_0016-2/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0016.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0016\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, we found two really great quilt shops in White Bear Lake and went on to Stillwater for a few more antique stores in the afternoon. I was so happy to finally visit Rosebud’s Cottage in White Bear Lake because I have been following the store’s owner Roseann Meehan Kermes on Facebook and also really enjoyed reading about her studio when she was profiled in American Patchwork and Quilting Magazine. Her shop was everything I thought it would be. It really reminded me of my own shop, almost the same size and with the same types of traditional  fabric and patterns. Her displays incorporate many antique items and furnishings. I bought some wool and a kit (that I really didn’t need but was super cute, The Night Before Christmas). Read more about <a href=\"http://www.rosebuds-cottage.com/\">Rosebud’s Cottage </a>and take a look at <a href=\"http://rosebudscottage.typepad.com/\">Roseann’s blog</a>. You’ll see why I love this shop!!!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-91\" data-attachment-id=\"91\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1316346657\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"6.2\",\"iso\":\"250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_0026\" data-large-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=523\" data-medium-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-permalink=\"https://patchesprints.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/junk-bonanza/img_0026-2/\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" srcset=\"https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=300 300w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=600 600w, https://patchesprints.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/img_0026.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"IMG_0026\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>We also visited <a href=\"http://www.bearpatchquilting.com/\">Bear Patch Quilting </a>which is just about a block and a half from Rosebud’s Cottage. Both of these shops have been honored as Quilt Sampler Shops, an amazing honor bestowed on them by American Patchwork and Quilting. There is a different atmosphere at each shop, each having their own personality and style. Bear Patch Quilting is much larger, less traditional, carrying batiks and novelty prints, as well as traditional fabrics and wool.

They live not far from there and were able to stop by for about 5 minutes, long enough to take this picture.

        "cleaned_post_text": "Yes, this is a quilt blog but for some reason quilting has been a little absent from my life lately. I’ve been doing a little traveling, just returning from California, visiting my daughter Michelle who recently moved to the Los Angeles area. It was a wonderful trip, we did some real touristy things including being part of the live studio audience at The Talk and also got her set with groceries and other things to start out life in California. A few weekends ago,  I accompanied my friends (Ginny, Pam, Connie and Deb) to Junk Bonanza in Shakopee, Minnesota. Again, not so much quilting . . . but the junking does relate to my quilting as I’m working on re-doing my sewing room and using some of the fun “junk” to re-organize fabric, wool, patterns, books and more.Junk Bonanza is an annual event run by Ki Nassauer (pictured with me above). Ki is the original “Junk Lady” going to flea markets, garage sales, salvage yards and more, repurposing and recycling items into decorative objects. Junk Bonanza combines “junk” and antiques at Canterbury Park, a racetrack in Shakopee. We drove up to Minnesota on Thursday, stopping at a few antique shops along the way. Our good friend, Connie, lives in Eaton MN. We arrived at her house that evening and enjoyed an excellent dinner before getting ready for our junking adventure the next day.Lots of treasures at Junk Bonanza on Friday, we went from booth to booth and also met Ki and got her to sign her latest copy of Flea Market Style. Read more atKi’s blogand you’ll see why we enjoy “junking” so much! Another fun part of Junk Bonanza is the bloody mary served up by Canterbury Park (Connie and Pam pictured with theirs below). If you are a fan of bloody marys, you ‘ll love these, especially the garnish which includes a shrimp, marinated garlic stuffed in a pepper, salami and cheese chunk and MORE!So following the break for Bloody Mary, we continued to “junk” with everyone finding lots of fun stuff. If this were a junking blog I would certainly detail all the finds but let’s just say, we all found our treasures, including jewelry, an old pharmacy cabinet, a seed packet stand with table, chairs and a lamp. The picture at the end of this post shows my purchases. The fun items for my revamped sewing room are the white drawer and the old mini-muffin tin. I’m going to use the drawer for my wool pieces, washed the drawer out thoroughly and sprayed with sealer.
