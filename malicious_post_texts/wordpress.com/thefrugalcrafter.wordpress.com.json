You waste a bit of time and materials. So what? I can waste gobs of time watching TV or scrolling on social media. The art supplies are already bought and paid for and if you are looking at stuff like stamps and stencils and brushes then can be used over and over again indefinitely. You might be out a few cents in paper, paint or ink but that’s about it. In most cases, you can give it a coat of gesso and carry on. The REAL waste is your paint or markers or inkpads going unused on your shelf to dry up or go bad. Now that’s what I’m afraid of, not making a mess, unspent potential. I think a lot of fear comes from shame. Are you worried about embarrassing yourself or someone judging what you make? Simple, make your art just for you, there is no law saying that we have to share everything. If you are going to let some random on social media keep you from creating because you are afraid what <em>they</em> will think you need to either not share it or think about why they have so much power over your actions.Â  There is so much pressure on our lives today we need a space where we can learn, stumble, make a mess and grow without worrying what anyone else thinks. Right now, right where you are, is the perfect place to start. You will not get better without practice. You are not obliged to share your work. You ARE allowed to share it if you want to. This is YOUR journey, you decide. Remember, what you see online is people’s highlight reel. Give yourself a chance to succeed, I’m rooting for you!</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"430\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAqcM2zN1nU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" width=\"764\"></iframe></span></div></div>",
