Today I’m here with another one of my pet chicken update post!</p>\n<p>It’s been a hot minute since I’ve talked about my chicken here, but up until recently there wasn’t much to talk about.</p>\n<p>If you couldn’t tell by the title of the post, this one is going to be a bit bittersweet for me because one of my little hens from the August hatchlings had passed away, then I had to get rid of the roosters that I had hatched last year back in May and August, and then I just received some little baby chicks in the mail last week.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When one <strong>door</strong> closes…</h2>\n<p>So, I know that I’ve talked about having at least 10 hens to one rooster if you were trying to have more than one rooster in you flock before, and going into the fall of 2020 I had a total of 14 hens and 6 roosters which was way out of proportion for the size of my chicken area and flock in general.</p>\n<p>There was “The Old Man” who is the dark Brahma rooster I have had since 2019 and my first rooster. When I had ordered my brahmas from Cackle Hatchery out of Missouri, I had ordered 3 of the dark Brahma hens and one rooster to watch over them and the 4 Orpingtons (who are a couple months older than the Brahmas) I had bought from Tractor Supply. </p>\n<p>From my experience with Cackle, they send an extra baby chick with small orders (of less than 20 baby chicks I believe), and the other baby chicken was another little rooster, and the extra rooster had passed away a couple of hours after I had picked them up from the post office. I don’t know what exactly was wrong with him because my chickens were held up for a day somewhere and were delayed from getting to me. And just a little FYI, baby chicks are able to go without eating or drinking for a day after birth because they are still living off of the remaining part of the yolk from when they were born.</p>\n<p>I think the little rooster who had passed had some type of respiratory issue because he had looked healthy, but in the short amount of time that I had him, he was extremely tired. He was falling asleep while standing up and tumbling down. Then, towards the end, he was gasping for air.</p>\n<p>Then with the other rooster, The Old Man, who survived ended up having a “bad leg” where it had atrophied to basically nothing, and I was afraid that he was either going to die or face struggles later in life with only one leg. It was so hard watching that poor little chick struggle to get around and each day it got a little worse, then all of a sudden his leg was fine and it was like I had imagined the whole thing.</p>\n<p>The old man has a limp when he walks, but he’s strong and healthy now going on to years later. </p>\n<p>Then back in May I had hatched 5 eggs gracing me with three roosters and two hens. The roosters ended up being a dark Brahma like the dad and two Orpington x brahma mixes (see photo to the right). The two mixed roosters were always skittish from the start, so I didn’t hold them as much when they grew up and baby Brahma was well mannered but didn’t like being held for long periods of time like the old man. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-medium\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8048\" data-attachment-id=\"8048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone 6s Plus\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1615472028\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.15\",\"iso\":\"25\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0034843205574913\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"img_5530\" data-large-file=\"https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=676\" data-medium-file=\"https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=225\" data-orig-file=\"https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3024,4032\" data-permalink=\"https://laurenbodiford123.wordpress.com/img_5530/\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" src=\"https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=225\" srcset=\"https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=225 225w, https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=450 450w, https://laurenbodiford123.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/img_5530.jpg?w=113 113w\"/></figure></div></div>",

Ren will help Lukasz find his brother…if Lukasz promises to slay the Dragon.</p>\n<p>But promises are all too easily broken.”</p>\n<p><strong>A Breath too Late by Rocky Callen</strong></p>\n<p>“Seventeen-year-old Ellie had no hope left. Yet the day after she dies by suicide, she finds herself in the midst of an out-of-body experience. She is a spectator, swaying between past and present, retracing the events that unfolded prior to her death.</p>\n<p>But there are gaps in her memory, fractured pieces Ellie is desperate to re-assemble. There’s her mother, a songbird who wanted to break free from her oppressive cage. The boy made of brushstrokes and goofy smiles who brought color into a gray world. Her brooding father, with his sad puppy eyes and clenched fists.</p>\n<p>Told in epistolary-like style, Rocky Callen’s deeply moving <em>A Breath Too Late</em> sensitively examines the beautiful and terrible moments that make up a life and the possibilities that live in even the darkest of places. Perfect for fans of the critically-acclaimed <em>Speak</em>, <em>I’ll Give You the Sun,</em> and <em>If I Stay</em>.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kent State by Deborah Wiles</strong></p>\n<p>“May 4, 1970.</p>\n<p>Kent State University.</p>\n<p>As protestors roil the campus, National Guardsmen are called in. In the chaos of what happens next, shots are fired and four students are killed. To this day, there is still argument of what happened and why.</p>\n<p>Told in multiple voices from a number of vantage points — protestor, Guardsman, townie, student — Deborah Wiles’s <em>Kent State</em> gives a moving, terrifying, galvanizing picture of what happened that weekend in Ohio . . . an event that, even 50 years later, still resonates deeply.”</p>\n<p><strong>Seven Endless Forests by April Genevieve Tucholke</strong></p>\n<p>“On the heels of a devastating plague, Torvi’s sister, Morgunn is stolen from the family farm by Uther, a flame-loving Fremish wolf-priest who leads a pack of ragged, starving girls. Torvi leaves the only home she’s ever known, and joins a shaven-skulled druid and a band of roaming Elsh artists known as the Butcher Bards. They set out on a quest to rescue Torvi’s sister, and find a mythical sword.</p>\n<p>On their travels, Torvi and her companions will encounter magical night wilds and mystical Drakes who trade in young men. They will sing rowdy Elshland ballads in a tree-town tavern, and find a mysterious black tower in an Endless Forest. They will fight alongside famous Vorseland archers and barter with Fremish wizards. They will feast with rogue Jade Fell children in a Skal Mountain cave, and seek the help of a Pig Witch. They will face wild, dangerous magic that leads to love, joy, tragedy, and death.</p>\n<p>Torvi sets out to rescue a sister, but she may find it’s merely the first step toward a life that is grander and more glorious than anything she could have imagined.”</p>\n<p><strong>Incendiary by Zoraida Cordova</strong></p>\n<p>“<em>I am Renata Convida.</em></p>\n<p><em>I have lived a hundred stolen lives.</em></p>\n<p><em>Now I live my own.</em></p>\n<p>Renata was only a child when she was kidnapped by the King’s Justice and brought to the luxurious palace of Andalucia. As a memory thief, the rarest and most feared of the magical Moria, Renata was used by the crown to carry out the King’s Wrath, a siege that resulted in the deaths of thousands of her own people.</p>\n<p>Now Renata is one of the Whispers, rebel spies working against the crown. The Whispers may have rescued Renata years ago, but she cannot escape their mistrust and hatred-or the overpowering memories of the hundreds of souls she drained during her time in the palace.</p>\n<p>When Dez, the commander of her unit-and the boy she’s grown to love-is taken captive by the notorious Principe Dorado, Renata must return to Andalucia and complete Dez’s top secret mission herself. Can she keep her cover, even as she burns for vengeance against the brutal, enigmatic prince? Her life and the fate of the Moria depend on it.</p>\n<p>But returning to the palace stirs childhood memories long locked away. As Renata grows more deeply embedded in the politics of the royal court, she uncovers a secret in her past that could change the fate of the entire kingdom-and end the war that has cost her everything.”</p>\n<p><strong>Clique Bait by Ann Valett</strong></p>\n<p>“Chloe Whittaker is out for revenge.</p>\n<p>Last year her best friend Monica’s life was unceremoniously ruined by the most popular students at their high school, so this year Chloe plans to take each and every one of them down.
