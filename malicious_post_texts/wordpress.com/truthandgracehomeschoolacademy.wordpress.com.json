That’s a lot of books, but mostly she considers herself a “storyteller.” Her young adult novels (Diary of a Teenage Girl, True Colors etc.) appeal to teenage girls around the world. Her annual Christmas novellas become more popular each year. She’s won a number of awards (including RT’s Career Achievement Award, the Rita, and the Gold medallion) and some of her books have been optioned for film/TV. Carlson has two grown sons and makes her home in the Pacific Northwest with her husband and yellow Lab dog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>More from Melody</h1>\n<p>Writing about the WW1 era has definitely been a good history lesson for me. Prohibition laws in Oregon (and rum-runners breaking them) combined with a massive war that changed the world and a global epidemic is worth paying attention to. Especially since history sometimes repeats itself. The early 20th century had a lot going on—much that seems nearly forgotten. I’m glad to see the movie <em>1917</em> is doing well—and we plan to see it this week. Although I’m not a fan of gruesome war movies, this era continues to intrigue me. Even as I wrapped up my Sunset Cove series with Turning Tide I was left wondering . . . what’s next? But isn’t that the beauty of story?</p>\n<h1>Blog Stops</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://bibliophileandavidreader.blogspot.com/\"><span>The Avid Reader</span></a>, March 16</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sorcharaicheal.booklikes.com/\"><span>For the Love of Literature</span></a>, March 16</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tabithabouldinauthor.home.blog/\"><span>Through the Fire Blogs</span></a>, March 16</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://debbieloseanything.blogspot.com/\"><span>Debbie’s Dusty Deliberations</span></a>, March 17</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amandanicolle.blogspot.com/?m=1\"><span>Inklings and notions</span></a>, March 17</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truthandgracehomeschoolacademy.wordpress.com/\"><span>Truth and Grace Homeschool Academy</span></a>, March 18</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://debs-bookreview.blogspot.com/\"><span>deb’s Book Review</span></a>, March 18</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://allofakindmom.wordpress.com/\"><span>All-of-a-kind Mom</span></a>, March 19</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rbclibrary.wordpress.com/\"><span>By The Book</span></a>, March 19</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wishfulendings.com/\"><span>Wishful Endings</span></a>, March 19</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://deana0326.blogspot.com/\"><span>Texas Book-aholic</span></a>, March 20</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shelivestoread.com/\"><span>She Lives To Read</span></a>, March 20</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bettimace/\"><span>Betti Mace</span></a>, March 21</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://remembrancy.com/\"><span>Remembrancy</span></a>, March 21</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://janicesbookreviews.com/\"><span>janicesbookreviews</span></a>, March 22</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mary.a.hake\"><span>Mary Hake</span></a>, March 22</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://familymgrkendra.blogspot.com/\"><span>Happily Managing a Household of Boys</span></a>, March 22</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://janemouttet.wordpress.com/\"><span>Library Lady’s Kid Lit</span></a>, March 23</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forhimandmyfamily.com/\"><span>For Him and My Family</span></a>, March 23</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://musingsbymaureen.blogspot.com/\"><span>Maureen’s Musings</span></a>, March 24</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydevotionalthoughts.net/\"><span>My Devotional Thoughts</span></a>, March 24</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nannie3.blogspot.com/\"><span>Jeanette’s Thoughts</span></a>, March 24</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.christianbookaholic.com/\"><span>Christian Bookaholic</span></a>, March 25</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://artistwriterandstudentohmy.wordpress.com/\">Artistic Nobody</a>, March 25 (Guest Review from Donna Cline)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://connie-oldersmarter.blogspot.com/\"><span>Older &amp; Smarter?</span></a>, March 26</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amybooksy.blogspot.com/\"><span>Locks, Hooks and Books</span></a>, March 26</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://montanamade.weebly.com/tell-tale-book-reviews\"><span>Tell Tale Book Reviews</span></a>, March 27</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carolkeen.blogspot.com/\"><span>Blogging With Carol</span></a>, March 27</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daysongreflections.com/\"><span>Daysong Reflections</span></a>, March 27</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.splashesofjoy.wordpress.com/\"><span>SPLASHES of Joy</span></a>, March 28</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vickysluitercom.wordpress.com/\"><span>Vicky Sluiter</span></a>, March 28</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amoderndayfairytale.net/\"><span>A Modern Day Fairy Tale</span></a>, March 29</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pausefortales.blogspot.com/\"><span>Pause for Tales</span></a>, March 29</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mommiebethers.blogspot.com/\"><span>For the Love of Books</span></a>, March 29</p>\n<h1>Giveaway</h1>\n<p><img class=\"\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://promosimple.com/uploads/images/8b8f8566-f66a-4fb9-9a0d-00e5a8bc07b1\" width=\"277\"/></p>\n<p>To celebrate her tour, Melody is giving away the grand prize package of a complete set of The Legacy of Sunset Cove series!!</p>\n<p>Be sure to comment on the blog stops for nine extra entries into the giveaway!

I know we can trust God, for He is the same. This book combines personal stories, Biblical stories, and Biblical Scriptures to prove how much we need to rely on God. At many places in this book, I found myself agreeing with what the author had to say.</p>\n<p>At other points in the book, I realized some things discussed such as what age Adam was when he was created by God never crossed my mind. I loved reading the personal stories that were included such as when the author was awoken from sound sleep with the simple command to pray. After some back and forth, the prayers were uttered. The next day he found out why it was so important that he needed to pray.</p>\n<p>Truly this book is heartfelt and Spirit-filled. I feel both believers and non-believers alike can benefit from this book. So check it out for yourself.</p>\n<p>I received a copy of this book for my fair and honest review.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>About the Author</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"Tom Wise\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.celebratelitteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tom-Wise.png\"/></p>\n<p>Tom and Nancy Wise are award-winning authors. Their first novel, The Borealis Genome, is the grand-prize winner of the Chanticleer Book Reviews Dante Rossetti 2013 Award for YA Novels and 2014 Cygnus Award Lab Lit Category.</p>\n<p>Thomas grew up in a military family moving from base to base as the child of a Marine, living the life of an officer’s brat in times of war while Nancy was raised the youngest child of a WWII veteran.

        "cleaned_post_text": "About the BookBook:Why Can’t We Trust God?Author:Thomas WiseGenre:Non-Fiction/Personal GrowthRelease Date:January 17, 2020So you think God turned his back on us?Why else would this world be so miserable?While this world is spinning out of control, we are left with the tough questions:Why is this happening to me?Why won’t God stop this?Why am I in pain?Why did my child die?Why do they hate me?WHY CAN’T WE TRUST GOD?Well, at the time my wife and I were suffering financially due to her loss of a good job. We wondered how we would pay our bills but chose to continue to trust in God as we paid our tithe and held our breath, hoping my income would cover our bills each month. We prayed for relief but never expected the answer would include the total destruction of everything we owned. The tornado crashed through the town, causing death and destruction to everything in its path.After the grief subsided at the loss of life suffered by our neighbors, we came to realize that we also lost all of our debts and the decay of the older home we owned. We received so much more than we lost.Clickhereto get your copy.Why Can’t We Trust God? caught my eye because of the title. I know we can trust God, for He is the same. This book combines personal stories, Biblical stories, and Biblical Scriptures to prove how much we need to rely on God. At many places in this book, I found myself agreeing with what the author had to say.At other points in the book, I realized some things discussed such as what age Adam was when he was created by God never crossed my mind. I loved reading the personal stories that were included such as when the author was awoken from sound sleep with the simple command to pray. After some back and forth, the prayers were uttered. The next day he found out why it was so important that he needed to pray.Truly this book is heartfelt and Spirit-filled. I feel both believers and non-believers alike can benefit from this book. So check it out for yourself.I received a copy of this book for my fair and honest review.About the AuthorTom and Nancy Wise are award-winning authors. Their first novel, The Borealis Genome, is the grand-prize winner of the Chanticleer Book Reviews Dante Rossetti 2013 Award for YA Novels and 2014 Cygnus Award Lab Lit Category.Thomas grew up in a military family moving from base to base as the child of a Marine, living the life of an officer’s brat in times of war while Nancy was raised the youngest child of a WWII veteran. When not working together on their novels, Tom teaches at University and authors articles on project management topics and nonfiction books published by Gower Publishing in the UK.More from Tom“Why Can’t We Trust God?” reflects my struggle with the purpose of suffering.
