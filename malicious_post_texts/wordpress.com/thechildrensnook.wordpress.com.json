 Jill Zabkar Martin has written an adorable book for children called, <em>Froggy Boots Go With Everything. </em>This story makes me smile every time I read it.  This fun board book shows how a little boy not only wears his froggy boots everywhere, but he also creatively uses his Froggy Boots in everything he does each day.  Illustrator, Kirsten Gaede Van Mourick, also did an amazing job of bringing a fun-loving little boy and frog to life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1995\" data-attachment-id=\"1995\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D40\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1254642853\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.016666666666667\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"ChildrensNook 252\" data-large-file=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=640\" data-medium-file=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3008,2000\" data-permalink=\"https://thechildrensnook.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/octobers-pick-froggy-boots-go-with-everything-review-giveaway/childrensnook-252/\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199\" srcset=\"https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=600 600w, https://thechildrensnook.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/childrensnook-252.jpg?w=150 150w\" title=\"ChildrensNook 252\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Another fun feature to <em><a href=\"http://www.froggyboots.com/\">Froggy Boots Go With Everything</a></em>, is that your child can search for the frog on every page.  One page of the story shows the little boy playing in a sandbox.  He is pouring sand out of one of his froggy boots to fill up the back of his toy dump truck.  My son finds it extremely funny to discover the frog in the cab of the toy dump truck every time we read the book!
