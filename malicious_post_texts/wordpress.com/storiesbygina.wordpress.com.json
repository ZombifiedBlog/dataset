Struggling with her own past since an assault left her pregnant, her future as a solo parent leaves her dreams uncertain. The inheritance from her great aunt gives Julia the ability to take a step back into her future, but also sends her into the discovery of a love story she’d never anticipated. As she goes through her aunt’s treasured possessions, Julia uncovers some oddly written piano music with a musical code she can’t decipher on her own. Not to worry, introverted Englishman and composer, Henry Wright, is thrust on the scene by a pair of homespun matchmakers who know the ‘right’ man for Julia’s wounded heart.</p>\n<p>Henry arrives in Pleasant Gap with the task of composing the soundtrack for his best mate’s newest film. The Jenkins’ family’s southern welcome and gregarious personalities set his reticent nature on edge, but he’s inexplicably drawn to his gentle and music-loving hostess, Julia. Uncertain how to build a friendship with the wounded woman, and rather hopeless in communicating well through words, the bond of music becomes a bridge between her uncertainty and his awkwardness.</p>\n<p>But her broken past and his families’ expectations build a wall much greater than the cultures that separate them. As they work together to solve a musical mystery from the grave, will an unlikely romance from the past inspire their hearts to trust in a God who’s written the perfect melody for their lives?</p>\n<p><strong>PURCHASE: </strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41394085-when-you-look-at-me\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Goodreads</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NFSVSd\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>My Thoughts:</h3>\n<p>Pepper Basham has a  casual and simply writing style and a fun voice to her stories. She is a new-to-me author, this is the first novel of hers that I’ve read. I enjoyed the story and there were moments that brought tears to my eyes and caught hold of my heart. I felt myself rooting for these characters and wanting to see them succeed and make the right choices, especially Julia.</p>\n<p><span style=\"display:inline !important;float:none;background-color:transparent;color:#3d596d;cursor:text;font-family:'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:19.2px;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0;\">When You Look at Me is a contemporary romance between two introverts who love music. Think music. Breathe Music. They shy away from the world around them and find solace in song. Tossed together by planning the engagement party for one of Julia’s seven siblings, they find that their inner souls commune with each other in a way they’ve never connected with another human being. </span></p>\n<p>I loved the music theme to this story as I am a musician myself and could relate well to these characters. I am also an introvert and could understand their social awkwardness and reluctance.  The beginning of the story moves very fast and I had some trouble following, but as I got into the book I caught on and enjoyed this story. I contribute some of my troubles with the fact that I have not read the first book, Just the Way You Are, and so I had to catch up with the current action. When You Look at Me can be read as a stand-alone, but I believe the story is much improved if you read the series in order.</p>\n<p>At first, the Appalachian authenticity felt forced, as if I was being repeatedly told its in Appalachia rather than experiencing it for myself. But again, the deeper I became in the story, the more I felt the Appalachian(ness) of the characters in both their speech and mannerisms.  I never felt the British(ness) of Henry and Wes, they never sounded English, except for the occasional use of mate or blok. I never “heard” their accent in my head.</p>\n<p>The theme of this story is courage to face whatever life throws at us and face whatever the future brings. Julia is carrying a child–the product of date-rape. She’s afraid of being a single mother and is uprooting her entire life to compensate for what she believes she can’t handle. As she sorts through the possessions of a beloved aunt, she uncovers a story of the past, one of love and courage. She finds herself growing and changing in ways she never imagined and her heart opens to greater possibilities than she ever thought possible.</p>\n<p>I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to lovers of sweet romances. This story will resonate in the hearts of those captivated by music, the Appalachian Mountains, and stories with real-life struggles.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"pepper basham\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1630\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://justreadtours.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/pepper-basham.jpg?w=200&amp;h=300\" width=\"200\"/></p>\n<p>Pepper Basham is an award-winning author who writes historical and contemporary romance novels with grace, humor, and culture clashes.
