        "post_text": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>If you read my <a href=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/2018/12/27/independent-reading-the-basics/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last post</a> you know that I just finished reading <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>No More Independent Reading Without Support</strong></span>, written by Debbie Miller and Barbara Moss. I highly recommend this book to anybody that wants to understand more about why independent reading is important, why we can not simply have independent reading without explicit teaching, why conferring with feedback is where the most significant teaching occurs, what reading workshop framework best supports independent reading time, and what research is available that supports our decision to have our students involved in independent reading EVERY day.</p>\n<p>The book also highlights what needs to be in place for independent reading in order for it to be a productive and effective time for our students.  These necessities will be the focus of this blog post.</p>\n<h2>Time to read</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, many students will not magically become readers outside of school if we do not set the groundwork for their literate lives in school.  It makes sense that students with less access to books are less likely to read outside of school.  Making the time to read regularly in school can help level the playing field for students.</p>\n<p>We should look closely at where we spend our minutes during the day. We have to be brutal and honest with ourselves. Are we spending time on purposeful learning that relates to the real world and will be useful to our students in ten years and into adulthood or are we relying on busy work? We will quickly see the benefits of opting for more time spent on actual reading time and less time spent on isolated skill practice such as vocab practice, spelling practice, word work, letter identification, etc.</p>\n<h2>More books read</h2>\n<p>Students need to read a large number of books and a variety of texts.  We need to rethink practices that decrease the number of books that our students could be reading.  We might want to reconsider the amount of time we spend on test prep activities or the practice of consistently having one novel for the whole class leading to about 4-6 novels read per school year.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">When we are working to increase the number of texts read it doesn’t help to have reading competitions. Having our students compete to read the most books or the most pages encourages surface level reading in which students are not doing the deep thinking that we always want them to be doing.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">It is essential that we increase the number of informational books our students are reading.  These books help our student to build academic vocabulary and background knowledge which leads to stronger comprehension.  Although there is more of an awareness about the importance of having a 50/50 diet of fiction/nonfiction, nonfiction books are still not in the hands of our students as often as they need to be.</p>\n<h2>Choice of texts</h2>\n<p>Allowing students to choose the books they want to read provides motivation. Teaching students through mini-lessons and conferences how to choose books provides them with a lifelong skill. Research has shown correlations between allowing students to choose their own books and improved comprehension, an increased amount of reading, and students choosing to read on their own time.</p>\n<h2>Explicit instruction</h2>\n<p>It is our responsibility to teach our students what, why, and how readers read.  For example, students need to know what is available for them to read. They need to know why you might choose to read a particular book. They need to know that readers approach books from different genres in different ways.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Students make the most growth when they have a teacher who can “help students identify appropriate, interesting materials, incorporating a range of genres and difficulty levels” (page 19). When we provide independent reading time without explicit instruction our striving readers do not make progress and may even develop poor perceptions about themselves as readers and start to resist reading time. These readers need extra guidance in choosing books that are not too hard. A steady diet of books that are too difficult will have negative effects in the long run.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">It is important to teach genre-specific strategies because the way you approach books of various genres is different. Knowing how to take on historical fiction, poetry, biographies greatly strengthens students’ abilities to think deeper and improves overall comprehension.</p>\n<h2>Teacher support/assessment</h2>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Conferences help with accountability, assessing, and provide scaffolding for our students through modeling, demonstrating, providing feedback, goal setting, and discussion. One-to-one conferencing is a means of providing the highest level of differentiation which is essential to the progress of our striving students.</p>\n<p>Conferences look different over time. During early conferences, we are doing a lot of listening to learn about our students as readers. This process allows us to get to know our students and build a trusting relationship. Over time our conferences become more about listening to our students talk about their reading and thinking in connection with the day’s learning target for the mini-lesson.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities to Reflect and Discuss</h2>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Responding to independent reading provides students with the opportunity to reflect on what they have read, the mini-lesson focus and how it relates to their reading, and their reading goals. Our read aloud time is a powerful time to use in the modeling of how reflecting might look and how to respond to each other.</p>\n<h2>In Summary</h2>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that our striving students will need more of all of these necessities.  They need more time to read, more books in their hands, more frequent conferencing, more support with how to choose books and more time to discuss books.  If you are missing any of these important pieces of independent reading this is a great time to make a goal for yourself and jump right in.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19\" data-attachment-id=\"19\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb1\" data-large-file=\"https://literacypages.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb11.png?w=118\" data-medium-file=\"https://literacypages.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb11.png?w=118\" data-orig-file=\"https://literacypages.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb11.png\" data-orig-size=\"118,55\" data-permalink=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb1-2/\" src=\"https://literacypages.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ml7ooogr9ehbrv53gvb11.png?w=640\"/></p>\n<p>Resource:</p>\n<p>Miller, D. and Moss, B.

        "post_text": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>The number one priority for literacy coaches is to build strong trusting relationships.  Just like with our students we have to take the time to get to know the teachers we work with to best collaborate with them.  Here are some of the strategies I have used to help with building and strengthening relationships with the teachers I have worked with.</p>\n<h2>Make small talk</h2>\n<p>Taking some time to socialize does wonders for building relationships.  Small talk helps teachers to relate to you not only as a fellow teacher but as a fellow human being.  Show an interest in the teacher’s family, hobbies, upcoming events, etc.  Ask about their family member who has been sick or the new puppy they got over break.  Show teachers that you care about them by taking a genuine interest in them beyond work topics.</p>\n<h2>Be visible and accessible</h2>\n<p>Coaches have many responsibilities that pull them in various directions.  It is important to advocate for being present in your building and in classrooms, rather than in meetings, planning for professional development, or dealing with paperwork.  Teachers need to see that you are in the trenches with them the majority of the time.  Helping out with various duties at your school also helps teachers to see you as one of them.  Be present in the active areas of the school like the faculty lounge or pop into a teacher’s room during the day (as long as you know they would welcome your presence).  Being visible in the building provides opportunities for teachers to run something by you when they pass you in the hallway.  These small interactions can open doors to possible future planned interactions with teachers.</p>\n<h2>Be trustworthy</h2>\n<p>This is probably one of the most important ways to build positive relationships with the teachers you work with.  Teachers are at their most vulnerable with coaches.  Coaches are privy to a lot of information about the teachers they work with.  Teachers share their goals with their coach, they teach in front of their coach, they share data with their coach.  They need to know that it is safe to be vulnerable with you as their coach.  <a href=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/2018/03/05/100-positive-experiences-experience-5-keep-it-confidential/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trustworthiness</a> is something that you will need to prove through your actions over time.  Sometimes we break this trust unintentionally.  An example would be sharing with administration something great you saw in a particular teacher’s room without that teacher’s permission.  That sounds like a positive thing to do right?  When this well-intentioned comment gets back to the teacher he may wonder if you have also shared negative information with his administrator.</p>\n<h2>Help out with little things</h2>\n<p>You have to be careful with this one because you don’t want to suddenly be in charge of making copies for an entire grade level.  You also don’t want teachers to become over-dependent on you.  Occasionally from time to time when the situation presents itself, you may want to volunteer to take something off a teacher’s plate.  For example, you are planning with a teacher who is talking with you about an upcoming author study that she is excited to be doing with her class.  You and the teacher share some powerful thinking and planning and go your separate ways. A few days later when you ask how things are going in passing she mentions she has struggled with finding time to touch base with the librarian to pull the books needed for the author study.  You could volunteer to contact the librarian to help get things rolling for the teacher.  Any little thing a teacher can check off their mile-long to-do list makes them happier.</p>\n<h2>Be transparent</h2>\n<p>It is important to be upfront with what teachers can expect when they work with you.  You will want to clarify your role and describe what type of work you can do together.  Let the teachers you work with know who you will be sharing information with and what type of information is shared.  Take the time to explain the purpose of any district initiatives.  When we aren’t as transparent as possible we risk coming off as secretive and untrustworthy which definitely does not support building relationships.</p>\n<h2>Be a leader not a boss</h2>\n<p>Our job is not to tell teachers what to do.  We are there to think collaboratively with teachers for various purposes.  <a href=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/100-positive-experiences-experience-4-really-listen/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen actively</a> to your teachers to find out what their goals are and <a href=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/100-positive-experiences-positive-experience-3-no-agendas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">what they want from their work with you.</a>  The more that coaches show through their actions that they are in the thick of things with teachers the stronger their relationships will be.  Be vulnerable by admitting that you make mistakes too and acknowledge that you don’t know everything.  Think positively about ALL of the teachers you work with (even the “hard” ones).  Recognize the individual strengths of each teacher and help them to use their strengths to grow in their craft.</p>\n<p>If you intentionally work to build relationships with teachers you will find that in time teachers will be more likely to work with you.  They will seek you out for support.  They will find value in your role as a literacy coach.</p>\n<p>Please check out our previous posts on 100 Positive Experiences</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://literacypages.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/100-positive-experiences-1-be-on-time-every-time/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#1 Be on time.

I’ve developed a better understanding of what features each book level contains and what type of word work to focus on at each level. Here are the steps I take when using the Literacy Continuum to help me select my emphases when planning for Leveled Literacy Intervention lessons.1.Deeply Analyze Running RecordsIt is not sufficient to simply find anaccuracyand self-correction rate. I have to look deeper at what my student is using and neglecting.  In a previous post I included the types of questions I ask myself whenanalyzing a running record.  Here is a recent running record from one of my students.  I try to capture the neglect of or use of strategic behaviors at the top of the running record.2.Note Reading BehaviorsI make copies of the pages from the Literacy Continuum of the guided reading level I am working in.  I do this so that I can mark it up with notes and highlighting. I start with reviewing the summary at the beginning of each level in the Literacy Continuum to give myself an overview of what students at this level look like.I highlight the behaviors I have evidence of from the running record. It is also helpful to look across a few running records to notice patterns over time.  You may notice that the student has control of the behavior some of the time, but is not doing it other times. I have found a lot of power in lifting what is partially under control.  I look for patterns and trends for each child as well as for the group.Please excuse the horrible copies.

        "post_text": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><em>Written by Gen</em></p>\n<p>Last year, in preparation for my daughter’s toddler years, I started looking for books to prepare myself for the inevitable “terrible twos.” That’s when I stumbled upon the book, <em>The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know About Raising Confident, Capable Kids</em>, by Jessica Joelle Alexander and Iben Dissing Sandahl. They suggested that there was not actually such a thing as the “terrible twos,” and it turns out, they are right! With a focus on empathy and positive reframing, this book changed me as a parent, but also as an educator.</p>\n<p>It seems that the Danish are the happiest people on earth, and have been for over 40 years. The authors are an American mom who is married to a Dane, and a Danish psychotherapist who have worked together to answer the question, <em>what makes Danish kids the happiest people on earth? </em></p>\n<p>Their theory is built upon this foundation:</p>\n<p><strong>P lay</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A uthenticity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R eframing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>E mpathy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>N o Ultimatums</strong></p>\n<p><strong>T ogetherness &amp; Hygge (Coziness)</strong></p>\n<p>While all of these pieces relate to education, what spoke to me most as an educator is the section on “no ultimatums.” In fact, there is an entire section entitled, “How the Danes Use No Ultimatums in School.” This idea flies in the face of everything I learned in my teacher preparatory classes. There, we became experts at making reward programs for individuals, small groups, and whole classes. We learned how to find a child’s “currency” and use it to make a child behave by giving and taking away based on a set of criteria. And what teacher hasn’t been in this type of power struggle, “you need to _______ right now, or else you will lose recess time!”</p>\n<p>After reading this book, I have changed my language and approach to conflict with all children, and it’s already working. As an interventionist, I take students from all classrooms–and they are often the ones with the “naughty” reputations. Yesterday, I was waiting patiently for the class of my student to walk in the large front doors from recess. As they did, I observed my little student begin to scale the railing of the handicapped ramp in the foyer. He had to have been 4 feet off the ground when I walked over to him. He looked at me as if he expected me to wag my finger at him and tell him to “get down or else.” But I didn’t say that. I approached him with empathy and said, “I’m just so worried about you. Come down here where it’s safe.” Then I offered him my hand, and down he came. He said to me, “I think I was okay up there.” That was my opening to dialogue with him about the importance of school rules in a calm, conversational tone. No power struggle. No ultimatums. Just empathy.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it works for my toddler, too!</p>\n<p>If you are an educator or parent of children of any age, I strongly recommend that you read this book immediately. It causes you to reevaluate your outlook and it reframes your thinking about how you interact with children. It brings the promise of peace and happiness to parent or educator relationships with the children in your life.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"atatags-370373-64d7af309cabb\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.initVideoSlot('atatags-370373-64d7af309cabb', {\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionId: '370373',\n\t\t\t\t\tformat: 'inread'\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t</script>\n</div></div>",

He looked at me as if he expected me to wag my finger at him and tell him to “get down or else.” But I didn’t say that. I approached him with empathy and said, “I’m just so worried about you. Come down here where it’s safe.” Then I offered him my hand, and down he came. He said to me, “I think I was okay up there.” That was my opening to dialogue with him about the importance of school rules in a calm, conversational tone. No power struggle. No ultimatums. Just empathy.Oh, and it works for my toddler, too!If you are an educator or parent of children of any age, I strongly recommend that you read this book immediately. It causes you to reevaluate your outlook and it reframes your thinking about how you interact with children. It brings the promise of peace and happiness to parent or educator relationships with the children in your life.",
