In order not to keep you long for reading this letter I will mention the reason that forces me to ask for the promotion within a company. I am working with AAA services during 5 years. I have started as a marketing executive. I thank you for the provided opportunity. During these five years I have gained a lot of  experience and qualification.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that after five years I can be considered as a candidate for promotion since I feel the potential that can be realised on the new level. I enjoy working in our company and don’t want to quit. Kindly ask you to consider me as a candidate for the promotion.
