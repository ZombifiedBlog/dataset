        "post_text": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>In a recent case, Plaintiff, a nurse employed by a county public health agency, underwent surgery on her left foot. Not long after she returned to work, Plaintiff was terminated from her position.  The reason for her termination included physical restrictions resulting from her surgery that limited her “capacity to perform the full clinical duties of a public health nurse.” Following her termination, Plaintiff filed an administrative charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), asserting that the County had discriminated against her and was in direct violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). In the charge, Plaintiff states that she had “requested a reasonable accommodation,” but was denied her desired relief. The charge did not describe the accommodation requested.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with her charge, Plaintiff completed an EEOC intake questionnaire. Plaintiff defined her physical restrictions as “limited walking ability; cannot lift more than 20 lb.; must use electric wheelchair if moving for any length of time; limited writing ability.” In response to the questionnaire’s instructions to “describe the changes or assistance that you asked for,” Plaintiff wrote that she wanted “to be assigned as Nurse of the Day and to be in the clinic doing lighter duty work.” Later in District Court, Plaintiff asserted that a “reasonable accommodation” would have included a wheelchair.</p>\n<p>The ADA dictates that a plaintiff must exhaust all administrative proceedings by filing a charge with the EEOC before filing a suit in federal court. Policy wise, this requirement ensures that the employer is put on notice of the alleged violations – providing the employer an opportunity to address the alleged discrimination prior to litigation. The county’s public health agency contended that Plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative options.</p>\n<p>The Court relied on precedent stating that “[t]he touchstone for exhaustion is whether plaintiff’s administrative and judicial claims are reasonably related.” The variation in her proposed accommodations from the EEOC questionnaire to those presented in District Court did not mean that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Furthermore, Plaintiff’s difficulties due to her surgery required some type of accommodation. The Court found that a<br/>\nrealistic accommodation for her specific disability was a wheelchair. Therefore, according to the Court, Plaintiff’s request was reasonable and flowed logically from the disability discussed in the questionnaire.</p>\n<p>For more information or for a consultation regarding your legal issues, please contact McCollum &amp; Associates, LLC, at (301) 864-6070 or jmccollum@jmlaw.net.</p>\n<div id=\"atatags-370373-64d7ac9c5c75d\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.initVideoSlot('atatags-370373-64d7ac9c5c75d', {\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionId: '370373',\n\t\t\t\t\tformat: 'inread'\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t</script>\n</div></div>",
