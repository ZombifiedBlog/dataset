The deadline for applying was April first. Naturally, we expected that they’d be swamped with applications.</p>\n<p>But it seems that we were wrong.  Today, at the creationist blog of the Discovery Institute, we found a new post begging for people to sign up for the thing. It’s titled <a href=\"https://evolutionnews.org/2023/03/summers-seminars-in-colorado-a-free-remedy-for-cancel-culture-applications-due-april-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Summer Seminars in Colorado â€” A FREE Remedy for Cancel Culture; Applications Due April 1</strong></a>, and it was written by Klinghoffer. Here are some excerpts, with bold font added by us for emphasis, and occasional Curmudgeonly interjections that look [<font color=\"red\">like this</font>]:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">In the current cancel culture [<font color=\"red\"><em>Huh?</em></font>] , you canâ€™t open your mouth to express a reasoned opinion without risking everything short of your life. The situation is bad in the media, but worse in academia.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it’s dangerous to be a creationist these days. Klinghoffer says:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Proponents of intelligent design experienced this well before other did. Considering what to do in light of the threat to free speech, we launched the Summer Seminars on Intelligent Design. <strong>The application deadline for this yearâ€™s Seminars is April 1. [<font color=\"red\">Klinghoffer’s bold font.</font>]</strong></span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Wowie</em> — creationists are suffering a threat to free speech, and that’s what their Summer Seminars are all about. Those folks are so brave! Klinghoffer tells us — again with his bold font:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><strong>Running June 26 to July 2, the Seminars are FREE and we can even help with transportation costs</strong> to the spectacularly beautiful Glen Eyrie Castle &amp; Colorado Conference Center. The instructors are the stars of the ID research community. [<font color=\"Green\"><em>Ooooooooooooh!</em></font> <font color=\"red\">The stars of the Discoveroid movement!</font>] The students â€” mostly undergrads and graduate students, plus a few professionals, teachers, and professors â€” are a remarkably diverse and interesting group.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It sounds absolutely wonderful! He continues:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">As one of our students last year said at the emotional concluding banquet, the Summer Seminars represent â€œscience as it should be, rather than science as it is.â€�  [<font color=\"red\">Hee hee!</font>] She was grateful to feel â€œsafeâ€� to explore fresh ideas about biological origins, and about the cultural consequences of those ideas. Very different from the oppressive atmosphere of many colleges and universities, here you can openly discuss the evidence for intelligent design without fear of being canceled.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Verily, it sounds like paradise — for creationists. Let’s read on:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">This yearâ€™s instructors include [<font color=\"red\">list of creationists</font>]. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Another excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">For more information and an easy online application, go here for the Seminar on Intelligent Design in the Natural Sciences [<font color=\"red\">Link omitted!</font>], and here  for the C. S. Lewis Fellows Program on Science and Society [<font color=\"red\">Link omitted!</font>].</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>And now we come to the end, with more of Klinghoffer’s bold font:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Do take note of that application deadline, however. <strong>April 1 is coming up fast!</strong></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, dear reader, what are you waiting for?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"background-color:#F2F2F2;font-style: normal;text-align: center\">Copyright Â© 2023. <a href=\"https://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/\">The Sensuous Curmudgeon</a>.
