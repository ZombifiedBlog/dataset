Title: Security Notification: Unauthorized Blog Posts by Attackers

Dear [Blog Service],

I am sending you this email to notify you to a security issue I have discovered on your [Blog Service].
I have confirmed that blog posts have been published at the following URL, which seems to have been posted by a third party rather than the blog's administrator.

URL: http://example[.]com, http://malicious[.]test, ...

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

[My Name]

[My Company]

[My Email Address]
